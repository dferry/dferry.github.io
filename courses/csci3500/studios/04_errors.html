<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 4<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Error Checking</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">


<p>Any non-trivial program requires you to call functions provided by either
the operating system or system libraries. These functions almost always provide
a return value, indicating whether an operation succeeded or failed. Checking
these return values are vital to producing robust code, and greatly simplify
debugging.</p>

<p><i>Checking return values appropriately will be a requirement for
lab 2 and all subsequent labs!</i></p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Look up return values in a function's man page
  <li>Check return values and handle errors appropriately
  <li>Print appropriate error messages with <code>perror()</code>
</ol>

Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file. When finished, submit your work via the Git repository.</p>

<!-- by sending your text file and
source code to <strong>dferry_submit@slu.edu</strong>
with the phrase <strong>
Error Checking
</strong> in the subject line.</p> -->

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Create a new file called <code>open.c</code>. Write a short program that
accepts a single command line argument. This argument should be interpreted as
a file name that your program attempts to open. Once the file is opened, your 
program should print the contents of the file to standard output. For example,
the command "<code>./open mars.txt</code>" should open the file 
<code>mars.txt</code> and print it to the console.
Use the <code>open()</code> function documented at <code>man 2 open</code>.</p>

<p><i>Hint:
start with your program from studio 2, called <code>copy.c</code>. Modify this
program to open a file, and then modify the <code>read()</code> statement to
read from your file descriptor rather than standard input. Alternately,
start with your program from Lab 1.</i></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste your working code.</p>  

<p><li>What happens when your argument specifies a file that doesn't exist?</p>

<p><li>Create a text file called <code>perm.txt</code> and fill it with some
short message. Execute the command "<code>chmod -rw perm.txt</code>". This 
command removes read and write permissions from the file. Now try to execute
your program on this file- what happens?</p>

<p><li>Look at the man page for <code>open()</code>. Around line 230 you will
see a section called "RETURN VALUE". What value does <code>open()</code>
return in the event of an error?</p>

<p><li>If you haven't already, insert an <code>if</code> statement directly
after your call to <code>open()</code> to check for errors. Your error detection
should check the criteria in the man page exactly. For example, if the
reported error value for <code>open()</code> is -1, then check 
with the conditional "<code>return_value == -1</code>" rather than something
like "<code>return_value &lt; 0</code>". As the answer to this exercise, copy
and paste the conditional you check.</p>

<p><li>The function <code>open()</code> also sets a special variable called
<code>errno</code>. Many system calls and library functions will set this
variable when they execute. If an error occurs, this variable tells the system
what happened. You can print a helpful error message with the function
<code>perror()</code>.</p>

<p>Insert a call to <code>perror()</code> inside your if statement from the
last exercise. The only argument to this function is a short message that
should describe the circumstances of the call. For example, <code>"Error
opening file"</code> or <code>"Error reading input"</code>.</p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste your call to 
<code>perror()</code>.</p>  

<p><li>Finally, your program should exit gracefully when an error occurs. Insert
a call to <code>return</code> or <code>exit()</code> with a negative value
inside your <code>if</code> statement, but after <code>perror()</code>. Leave
this answer blank.</p>

<p><li>Now, what happens when the argument to your program specifies a file that
doesn't exist?</p>

<p><li>What happens when the argument specifies the file without read or write
permissions- <code>perm.txt</code>?</p>

<p><li>Look at the following manual pages and determine what value(s) are
returned in the event of an error, and whether these functions set 
<code>errno</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>man 2 open
<li>man 2 close
<li>man 2 read
<li>man 2 write
<li>man 3 printf
</ul>

<p><li>Give two reasons why error checking in this manner simplifies software
development.</p>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<p><li>The special variable <code>errno</code> is documented at
<code>man errno</code>. There are a huge number of possible error statuses.
Some of these are generic (e.g. insufficient permissions), while others
are very specific (e.g. network host is unreachable). </p>

<p>Having detailed error
reporting presents the possibility that your programs can detect an error
and attempt to self-correct, rather than quitting or crashing. For example,
a common error status is <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EBUSY</code>, both of
which indicate that an OS resource is currently unavailable. Rather than
quitting, your program could simply wait and try again later.</p>

<p>Browse through <code>man errno</code> and think about how you might handle
some of the errors that can arise.</p>
