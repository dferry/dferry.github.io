<h2 style="text-align: center;">Layer 5: Session - Linux Sockets</h2>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Sockets are a fundamental abstraction for many types of
computer communication- both inside a single machine and over networks.
They are the basic primitives used to connect machines together, and
they are used to implement all kinds of networked communication. Despite
this, they are surprisingly simple to use, as they encapsulate and hide virtually
all of the technical details need to accomplish such communication, and
are accessed (like many other things in Linux) just like you were reading
or writing a local file.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up and configure sockets with <code>socket()</code>, <code>bind()</code>, and <code>listen()</code>
  <li>Recieve and make a socket connection with <code>accept()</code> and <code>connect()</code>
  <li>Use sockets to send data between processes within a system
  <li>Connect to a remote server on the internet
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>The goal of this studio is to establish a local connection between
two processes on the same machine. We'll write two programs: a server
and a client. First we will write the server, whose role is to create 
the communications channel and to
<i>listen</i> for incoming connections. A good example of how to construct
a basic server can be found in <code>man 2 bind</code> under the section
labeled EXAMPLE. Feel free to copy this code, but be sure to cite it.</p>

<p>Your server should perform the following actions:
<ol>
<li>First, create a socket with the system call <code>socket()</code>. To
create a local connection use the domain <code>AF_LOCAL</code>
(or equivalently <code>AF_UNIX</code>), the connection type
<code>SOCK_STREAM</code>, and protocol zero.
<li>Second, create the communications channel with the <code>bind()</code>
system call. This associates your socket from step one with a machine-visible
address. In the case of <code>AF_LOCAL</code>, this address is a path in the
file system. Directions on how to specify a local address in this way can be
found at <code>man 7 unix</code>.
<li>Now, having created the channel, your program needs to declare that it is
going to listen for incoming connections with the <code>listen()</code> system
call. Sockets only allow one process to connect at a time, so the second parameter
determines how many connection requests can wait in line before they are rejected.
<li>Use the <code>accept()</code> system call to accept a connection
over the socket interface. If no connection is immediately available then this
system call will, by default, cause your program block until another program
attempts to connect.
<li>When your program successfully returns from <code>accept()</code> the
connection has been established. You may read and write data over the channel
with the lower level <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> system
calls, or you can instantiate a stream interface with the <code>fdopen</code>
function. When doing so, be sure to use the socket descriptor returned by
the call to <code>accept()</code>, not the one created by the initial call
to <code>socket()</code>. Have your server read from the socket and print
what it gets to the console.
<li>Finally, use the system call <code>unlink()</code> in order to destroy
the socket and connection before the program returns.
</ol>

<p><i><b>Note:</b></i> Many things can go wrong with socket-based communication.
As usual, you should always check function return codes to detect errors. Recall
that most functions allow you to print a descriptive error statement with a
line of code such as:
<code>perror("Error calling bind()")</code>.
</p>

<p><li>Now we will write a client program. We will make use of the previously
created communications channel. In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a communications endpoint with a call to the <code>socket()</code>
system call.
<li>Establish a connection with the <code>connect()</code> system call. This
requires using the same socket address struct as the call to <code>bind()</code>.
</ol>

<p>At this point, barring any errors, your communcations channel is ready to
be used. Send some messages to the server program and print them to standard
output in order to validate the functionality.
Copy and paste the server output as the answer to this exercise. 
Note that a call to read an empty socket will block until data is available.</p>

<p><li>If you haven't already, refactor your server with an event loop so that
it will stay alive through multiple connection attempts. This requires that
your server make multiple calls to <code>accept()</code>, but not to
<code>listen()</code> or <code>bind()</code>. 
Print a message each time a new connection is established and run your client program
several times with the same server to validate this behavior. Copy and paste
the server output as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>Rather than having your server stay alive forever, have your program
terminate when it recieves the message "quit". Use the function
<code>strncmp</code> to test for string equality. The similar function
<code>strcmp</code> is unsafe.</p>

<p>Copy and paste terminal output demonstrating this functionality</p>

<!--
<p><li><b><i>Note:</b> Due to SLU's firewall, this exercise probably won't
work unless attempted from Hopper. For a lot of other reasons, it might not work at all.</i></p>

<p>The primary use of sockets is to manage networked connections between
remote computers. The final exercise of this studio will have you connect to
a Raspberry Pi at the instructor's office and receive a message.</p>

<p>Use your client program as a template, but we will modify it to use an
internet connection rather than a local connection. You will connect to
port <code>17000</code> at IP address <code>165.134.107.80</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Include the files <code>netinet/ip.h</code> and <code>arpa/inet.h</code>.
<li>Modify your call to <code>socket()</code> to specify an internet connection
type with <code>AF_INET</code>.
<li>Create a struct of type <code>sockaddr_in</code> to specify the internet
address. This struct is documented at <code>man 7 ip</code>. Set the
<code>sin_family</code> field to <code>AF_INET</code>, the <code>sin_port</code>
field to <code>htons(port_num)</code>, where <code>htons()</code> is a function
that translates between numeric representations on your computer and the network.
Third, use the function <code>inet_aton()</code> to translate a c-style string
containing the target IP address and store it at <code>sin_addr</code> using the
second argument.
<li>Finally, make the connection using <code>connect()</code> After opening the
connection, read the message from the socket and print it to standard out. This
server will refuse any data you send to it.
</ol>

<p>As the answer to this question, copy and paste the output from your terminal.
You might be unable to complete this exercise- the internet is a complex and
fault-prone place! Unexpected reboots or network issues may cause the server to
be unreachable. If you believe that your client is correct, but still cannot connect,
give a descriptive error message using
<code>perror()</code>.</p>
