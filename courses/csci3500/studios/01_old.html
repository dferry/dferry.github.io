<p>Welcome to Operating Systems! In this course we will submit assigments 
by using GitHub.  Let's get started with two simple "Hello, world!" programs
that demonstrate the difference between doing standard output with the
C standard library versus Linux system calls.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for a GitHub account, if you don't already have one
  <li>Create a GitHub repository for this class
  <li>Write a "Hello, world!" program using the C standard library
  <li>Write a "Hello, world!" program using Linux system calls
  <li>Add these programs to your GitHub repository
</ol>

Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file called exercises.txt. When finished, commit your source code and
exercises to your GitHub repository, and email <strong>dferry@slu.edu</strong>
a link to your solution in the repository with the 
phrase <strong>
Hello, world!
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>
