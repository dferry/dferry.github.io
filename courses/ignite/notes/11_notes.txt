Chapter 6 Notes

- What is our purpose?
  - Intelligent design, or more generally, are people created with a purpose?
  - Are we not created with a purpose, and our goal is to derive our own purpose in life?
    - Hole puncher vs. humans- the hole puncher was concieved and created for a purpose.
  - Anxiety of freedom: What do we do, when we're confronted with with the
    choice to decide what we do?
    - Mission statement: Guiding principles for an organization

- Where are computers in this?
  - Some computers are created for specific purpose.
  - Most programs are created for a specific purpose.
  - However, the universal turing machine shows us that there are universal
    machines that can run any program. Here, we can create a machine without
    a specific purpose in mind at inception, and give it a purpose later.

- More generally with AI, what would an AI think its purpose is? 
  - Utility function?
  - Could it derive its own purpose?
  - How do humans safely and effectively imbue a purpose to an AI?
    - Paperclip thought experiment, or even paperclip game
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer
    - Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics

- The Anti-Expert?
  - Restricting the domain of discourse to a specific topic might be harder for
    bots.
  - A less-restricted domain might be easier to deal with, from a turing test
    point of view.

- With regard to chatbots:
  - Chatbots have no purpose other than to chat, "they have nowhere else to be."
  - Purpose-directed conversation might be a way to break chatbots or ferret
    out the machines from the people. 
  - Would a person get exasperated with random behavior? Would a chatbot?
  - Purpose is part of having a consistent persona.

- There are business purposes for expert systems that have extensive
    knowledge in a specific subdomain (like IKEA furniture or a phone tree
    system.)
  - Are there good reasons to build general purpose systems that can have
    discussions in any realm? 
 

In class:
  - Activity: Think of your purpose. You do not need to share it.
  - Discuss: Without sharing your purpose, in what ways does your purpose 
             shape your behavior? 


  - Activity: The anxiety of freedom - mission statement
    - Google mission statements
    - Write your own mission statement for your life
      - Answer some questions:
        - What kind of person do you want to be?
        - What kinds of things do you want to do?
        - What kind of feeling do you want to exemplify?
        - What kind of relationships do you want to have?
        - Who inspires you? Why do you admire them?
      - Based on those answers, Write out your core values and goals:
        - E.g. Adventure, creativity, education, discipline, service, ... 
        - E.g. "Learn to program"
      - Write out a few Big Ideas that cover all your values
        and goals
      - Write out a mission statement
        -
