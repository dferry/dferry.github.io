<P>
The chapter The Migratory Soul explores several contexts for what might be considered
the center of our humanity. This question spans several contexts:
</P>

<ul>
	<li>Socially and culturally, do we value our heart or mind, body or intellect? ("Hey, I'm up here.")</li>
	<li>In language, what idioms do we use? Do we say, "That shows a lot of heart," or "That shows a lot of liver"?</li>
	<li>Spiritually and religiously, is our soul, psyche, or essence a tangible thing that is attached to our bodies, or is it separate? What is its purpose? Does it reside in a specific place?</li>
	<li>What makes a life most worth living? Aristotle proposed the concept of eudaimonia and arete. Other ethics systems emphasize personal and social outcomes (consequentialism) or rules and discipline (deontology).</li>
</ul>

<P>
Whatever the source of our personhood- soul, intellect, ability to reason logically, etc.- the chapter also examines fundamental questions of selfhood. Is the notion of a person as a single monolithic intellect the best model?
</P>

<ul>
	<li>Split brain patients can show the ability to reason and percieve with the left and right halves of their brain independently.</li>
	<li>Humans don't seem to follow perfectly rational behavior economically. When the emotional part of a brain is compromised, such persons can have difficulty making trivial decisions.</li>
	<li>Rationality bias- we seem to favor the notion of rationality as the seat of our being, but many of the problems we have to tackle in life are not questions of strict rationality.</li>
	<li>Hemispheric bias- we spend our entire schooling years mainly training our left hemisphere of our brains, perhaps to the detriment of our whole being: "As children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side."</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Written Reflection Exercise</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reflect on the nature of what it means to be human, to have a fulfilling life, and/or to engage in meaningful human activity. When you think about the chapter, what kind of person do you want to be? What concepts resonate most strongly with your life?</li>
	<li>Your submission should be 500-1000 words in length, roughly two to four pages double-spaced.</li>
	<li>You need to quote at least once from the book for full credit.</li>
	<li>You may use your notes from our Ignatian reflection activity in class, and this might be a way to structure your reflection. (Context, Experience, Reflection, Action, Evaluation)</li>
	<li>Submit your work via the Assignments page on Canvas. (I strongly suggest you use a separate text editor to prepare your submission.)</li>
</ul>

Your reflection may be as broad or narrow as you wish. Some specific reflection questions you might tackle are:
<ul>
	<li>What more sets us apart from the animal kingdom and/or computers? Our minds or our bodies?</li>
	<li>What do you want to do with your life and why do you think that will be fulfilling?</li>
	<li>Does society over-emphasize the role of rationality in being human?</li>
	<li>Take an especially meaningful quote from the book and expound on why you found it significant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Good reflections make a statement and support it with evidence. You can use our class text as a source of evidence, but you may also (and are encouraged) to use other sources as well as your own life experiences.
