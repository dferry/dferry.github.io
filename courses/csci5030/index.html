<h3><a name="Course Description">Course Description</a></h3>

<p>Software engineering perhaps stands alone as a technical discipline in which
there are no universally accepted techniques (either in academia or industry)
that everyone agrees produces good software. Instead, there are a wide variety
of practices that have grown up around a diverse set of organizations and philosophies. 
Rather than
cataloguing all these techniques and attempting to prescribe their uses, we
will look at succesful case studies, listen to experienced veterans describe
their approaches, and try to develop an intuition of how successful software
projects are run in practice. We will also get hands-on experience with the 
tools and techniques of a modern software development ecosystem, and put these
into practice in a semester-long team project.</p>

<p>
The three elements of this course are class meetings, quizzes, and a
project. This course will be taught as a graduate style seminar- some meeting 
times will be used for lecture, but out-of-class readings will also be the
basis for in-class discussions. Quizzes will evaluate the student's
understanding of class readings. </p>

<p>The course project will be an exercise in agile software development. 
Effort on the project will be structured around two week sprints. You will
be evaluated at four milestones: prototyping after two weeks, an alpha product around midterms, a beta product at six weeks, and a final version at the end of
classes. You will be evaluated on the quality of your product and your
group's adherence to process, as well as your individual contributions.
Your individual performance will be evaluated by Git commit logs,
your participation in code reviews of others' commits, and peer evaluations. </p> 

<p>
Definite topical outline:
<ul>
  <li>Software development processes
  <li>Agile and Scrum
  <li>Version control and branching
  <li>Software testing principles, test-driven development
  <li>Overview of software design and architecture
  <li>Code review process
  <li>Design patterns
  <li>Code standards
  <li>Technical debt and refactoring
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Assessment Objectives- at the completion of this course, students will be able to:
<ul>
  <li>Conduct a software development project as part of a team, using an agile process
  <li>Make effective use of a modern version control system
  <li>Use principles of software design in the implementation of a medium or large scale software project
  <li>Design and implement thorough test suites
  <li>Conduct effective code reviews
  <li>Apply methods for refactoring existing code
</ul>
</p>

<p><i><b>Catalog Description:</b>An overview of software development at a graduate level, including software engineering processes, software design and architecture, testing and quality assurance, and selected other topics of interest to software practitioners.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<h3><a name="gitinfo">SLU Git Repository</a></h3>

<p>Version control software is used to track changes to all artifacts
related to this course. Most importantly this means project source
code, but you should track absolutely all of your work using version
control: data files, config files, build scripts, test code,
documentation, READMEs, licence files, project websites and
other resources, and so on.<p>

<p>Some things should not be tracked: generated files such as
intermediate compilation products and binary executable files bloat the
repository, and can't be used unless the server environment is totally
replicated by the user. Dependencies such as libraries should be indicated
and not replicated, unless you're willing to take on the challenge of
regularly updating and maintaining those libraries as well.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why version control is a universal software
development tool:
<ul>
  <li>Makes collaboration easier. Shared, up-to-date code base.
  <li>Tracks history of every change with log message explaininig the reason for it. 
  <li>Backup of all files. A single hard drive crash or backpack theft shouldn't kill your grade or bankrupt your startup.
  <li>Serves as a crude method of effort tracking.
  <li>Essential for debugging and "root cause analysis". Find exact commit that introduced a given bug. Can "diff" between any two stored versions. 
  <li>Attributes every line to a feature or specification: most tools allow "blame view" - look at a file with each line annotated by the person who added that line and a reference to the commit that added.
  <li>Allows you to maintain multiple "branches" of a project. Stable branch, "next" branch for next stable release, "trunk" or bleeding edge branch, etc. We'll do case studies of how different projects handle this.
  <li>Branching allows fearless experimentation. Create a branch, try something and if it doesn't work, discard the branch. If it does, "merge" in with the main development branch. And if you change your mind after merging, you can still "revert" at any time.
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Textbooks">Textbook and Class Resources</a></h3>

<p>In lieu of a textbook, we will have online readings and other media throughout the semester.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="readings">Class Readings</a></h3>

<p>Readings are a crucial part of this course. The goal of our readings is to
hear from successful, real-world practitioners and ground our dicussions in
current industrial practice. Readings are frequently written articles, but
will also include videos and other media.</p>

<p>If the schedule has a reading listed for a given date then you should
consume that material prior to that class period and come ready to discuss 
it on that date. Please be thoughtful and reflective about our readings,
as the quality of the discussion (and in turn, what you and your peers
get from the course) is directly related to your preparation.</p>

<p>A great general-purpose way to respond to any content (in this course
or in any other course) is to answer the following questions:

<ol>
	<li>What do you remember from the reading/video?</li>
	<li>What was confusing, or what do you still have questions about?</li>
	<li>What stuck out to you or surprised you?</li>
	<li>What did you see/read/hear that connects to something you've
	learned or experienced previously (in this course or outside it)?</li>
	<li>How would you use this in the future?</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>Please feel free to go further than this in responding to any of the course
material, but if you can answer these questions for yourself then you are
probably adequately prepared for our class discussions.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>

<p>The semester schedule for quizzes is known well in advance. 
<b>Make up quizzes will only be given for severe and documented reasons.</b></p>

<p>Your grade will be determined as follows:</p>

<table border="3">
<tr>
	<th>Activity</th>
	<th>Grade Percentage</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Project</td>
	<td>50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Quizzes</td>
	<td>35% (5% each)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Class Participation</td>
	<td>15%</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Grading is done on a straight scale (uncurved). The following scores are guaranteed. The grading scale may be curved upwards (in your favor)
at the discretion of the instructor.

<ul>
<li> 93% guarantees an A
<li> 90% guarantees an A-
<li> 87% guarantees a B+
<li> 83% guarantees a B
<li> 80% guarantees a B-
<li> 77% guarantees a C+
<li> 73% guarantees a C
<li> 70% guarantees a C-
<li> 60% guarantees a D
</ul>

</p>

<p>Project work assigned for this course is generally expected to be
completed collaboratively. However, the sharing of written work or
code between teams is strictly prohibited. Quizzes are individual
assignments and collaboration is strictly prohibited. Occasionally,
the readings for classes may include non-credit exercises designed to
inform or enhance your understanding of the material. These non-credit
exercises may be completed collaboratively. </p>

<p>Some specific guidelines for this course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code you submit as part of the project must be written by you or your team. You are not allowed to copy code. Copying code, even small portions, in an industrial setting can lead to
serious legal and financial consequences for both you and your employer.</li>
<li>Copying small pieces of code from man pages, online references or other sources is generally acceptable, but to be safe you should check with me first. <b>Code from such sources must be cited</b> with a comment denoting the start and finish of the copied section.</li>
<li>Copied code that is not cited will be considered plagiarism and will be treated as cheating. Citing your code protects you from this. However, copying large portions of code is still grounds for a reduction in grade, even if it is not cheating. Please check with the instructor if you are copying more than a few lines of code!  
</ul>

<hr>

<H2>
<a name="Attendance Policy">Attendance</a>
</H2>

<p>Successful students attend all or mostly all class sessions. This is true
in my experience <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187078">and has been demonstrated in large scale studies</a> as well.
In that study, even students who attended nine out of ten class periods had
measurably lower class performance than those who attended all classes. However,
there is no attendance requirement for this class, and you do not need to
get permission when you do miss class. You are an adult and have
the freedom to manage your time in whatever way you feel is most useful.
Job interviews, conferences, tests in other courses, etc. are all reasonable
cases for being absent.</p>

<p>Note that in-class assignments such as tests or quizes cannot be made
up outside of class without prior approval from the instructor. All such
activities will be listed course schedule with ample time to prepare
(i.e. there are no "pop quizes").</p>

<p>If you do miss class you should refer to the course schedule to see what was
missed and arrange to get course notes from another student. I am always happy
to answer questions but I do not repeat full class periods in office hours.</p>

<h2><a name="COVIDmasks">Mandatory Syllabus Statement on Face Masks for AY2021-2022</a></h2>

<p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, key safeguards like face masks have allowed SLU to safely maintain in-person learning. If public health conditions and local, state, and federal restrictions demand it, the University may require that all members of our campus community wear face masks indoors.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, any time a University-level face mask requirement is in effect, face masks will be required in this class. </strong>This expectation will apply to all students and instructors, unless a medical condition warrants an exemption from the face mask requirement (see below).</p>

<p><strong>When a University-wide face mask requirement is in effect</strong>, the following will apply:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Students who attempt to enter a classroom without wearing masks will be asked by the instructor to put on their masks prior to entry. Students who remove their masks during a class session will be asked by the instructor to resume wearing their masks.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Students and instructors may remove their masks briefly to take a sip of water but should replace masks immediately. The consumption of food will not be permitted.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Students who do not comply with the expectation that they wear a mask in accordance with the University-wide face mask requirement may be subject to disciplinary actions per the rules, regulations, and policies of Saint Louis University, including but not limited to those outlined in the <em>Student Handbook</em>. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>dismissal from the course(s)</p>

</li>
<li><p>removal from campus housing (if applicable)</p>

</li>
<li><p>dismissal from the University</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>To immediately protect the health and well-being of all students, instructors, and staff, instructors reserve the right to cancel or terminate any class session at which any student fails to comply with a University-wide face mask requirement.</p>

<p><strong>When a University-wide face mask requirement is not in effect</strong>, students and instructors may choose to wear a face mask or not, as they prefer for their own individual comfort level.</p>

<p><strong>ADA Accommodations for Face Mask Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Saint Louis University is committed to maintaining an inclusive and accessible environment. Individuals who are unable to wear a face mask due to medical reasons should contact the Office of Disability Services (students) or Human Resources (instructors) to initiate the accommodation process identified in the University's <a href="https://www.slu.edu/human-resources/pdfs/policies/americans-disabilities-act-policy.pdf" >ADA Policy</a>.

</H2>

<p><strong>2021-2022 Mandatory Syllabus Statement on In-Person Class Attendance and Participation</strong></p>

<p>The health and well-being of SLU's students, staff, and faculty are critical concerns, as is the quality of our learning environments. Accordingly, the following University policy statements on in-person class attendance are designed to preserve and advance the collective health and well-being of our institutional constituencies and to create the conditions in which all students have the opportunity to learn and successfully complete their courses.</p>

<ol ><li><p>Students who exhibit any <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" >potential COVID-19 symptoms</a> (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) shall absent themselves from any in-person class attendance or in-person participation in any class-related activity until they have been evaluated by a qualified medical official. Students should contact the <a href="https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-health/index.php" >University Student Health Center</a> for immediate assistance.
</p>

</li>
<li><p>Students (whether exhibiting any of potential COVID-19 symptoms or not, and regardless of how they feel) who are under either an isolation or quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official must absent themselves from all in-person course activities per the stipulations of the isolation or quarantine directive.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Students are responsible for notifying their instructor of an absence as far in advance as possible; when advance notification is not possible, students are responsible for notifying each instructor as soon after the absence as possible. Consistent with the <a href="https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/attendance/" >University Attendance Policy</a>, students also are responsible for all material covered in class and must work with the instructor to complete any required work. In situations where students must be absent for an extended period of time due to COVID-19 isolation or quarantine, they also must work with the instructor to determine the best way to maintain progress in the course as they are able based on their health situation.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Consistent with the <a href="https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/attendance/" >University Attendance Policy</a>, students may be asked to provide medical documentation when a medical condition impacts a student's ability to attend and/or participate in class for an extended period of time.</p>

</li>
<li><p>As a temporary amendment to the current <a href="https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/attendance/" >University Attendance Policy</a>, all absences due to illness or an isolation/quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official, or due to an adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine, shall be considered "Authorized" absences</p>

<a name="Academic Integrity">Academic Integrity</a>
</H2>

<P>
<em>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible
conduct in all academic endeavors.</em>
The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the
greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."
Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the
corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and
community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The
University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and
professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of
academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
</p>
<p>
The governing
University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring
2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: <a
href="https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf">https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own
academic integrity policies, available on their respective
websites. All SLU students are expected to know and abide by
these policies, which detail definitions of violations,
processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and
appeals. Please direct questions about any facet of academic
integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your
academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or
Center in which your program is housed. Specific College of Arts
and Sciences Academic Honesty Policies and Procedures may be
