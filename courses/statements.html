<p><em>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors.</em> The mission of Saint Louis University is &ldquo;the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.&rdquo; Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service through which SLU fulfills its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern. The full University-level Academic Integrity Policy can be found on the Provost&apos;s Office website at: <a href="https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/academic-integrity-policy.pdf">https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/academic-integrity-policy.pdf</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;background: transparent;">Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;background: transparent;">Please contact the Center for Accessibility and Disability Resources (CADR) to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St. Louis campus will contact CADR, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at <a href="mailto:accessibility_disability@slu.edu">accessibility_disability@slu.edu</a> or by phone at 314.977.3484. Once approved, information about a student&rsquo;s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from CADR and within the instructor&rsquo;s official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to CADR. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;line-height: 100%;text-align: left;background: #ffffff;margin-right: -0.13in;">Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic or dating violence, we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, <strong>that faculty member must notify SLU&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator that you shared an experience relating to Title IX.&nbsp;</strong> This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.</p>
