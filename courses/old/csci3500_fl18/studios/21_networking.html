<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 21<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Intro to Networking</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Networking concepts are important, but so are networking tools. Modern
machines have a variety of useful utilities that help you to understand
the networks that a machine is connected to, and how data flows to and
from your machine. In this studio we will explore several of these
command line utilities.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a few basic command-line utilities related to networking
<li>Analyze the TCP/IP and the OSI network model
</ol>

<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file. When finished, submit your work by sending your text file and
source code to <strong>dferry@slu.edu</strong>
with the phrase <strong>
Intro to Networking
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>In the TCP/IP model, layer two (the internet layer) handles the communication of data between different
physical devices. To facilitate this all network-connected devices are assigned an <i>internet protocol address</i>,
or IP address. The <code>ifconfig</code> command provides a variety of information, including this data.
Issue the <code>ifconfig</code> command and copy/paste the entry under "br0".</p>

<p><li>What are the current IP addresses? These are given by the fields "inet" and "inet6"</p>

<p><li>On a computer with more than one physical network connection, it becomes important to distinguish these different
physical devices. This is done through a <i>hardware address</i>, also known as a <i>MAC address</i> or <i>ethernet address</i>.
What is the hardware address for this interface? It is given by the field called "ether".</p>

<p><li>One general concept in networking is that of <i>hosts</i>. Loosely, a host is any device
that is capable of making or recieving network connections. You can find the current <i>hostname</i>
of the machine you are currently using with the command <code>hostname</code>. What does this
command give?</p>

<p><li>You can look up information about other machines, <i>remote hosts</i>, with the
<code>host</code> command. Try using the <code>host</code> command with a website that you
visit. What information is returned?</p>

<p><li>Try using the <code>host</code> command with <code>slu.edu</code>. This returns multiple
IP addresses. Speculate a reason for why this one host maps to multiple IP addresses.</p>

<p><li>Wikipedia maintains a list of network protocols by their placement in the OSI model:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model)</a></p>

<p>For this last exercise, pick out one protocol from each traditional layer. Briefly describe
what it does and, if you can, give short justification for why you think it's been listed at that layer.
Some layers, like layers 4, 5, and 6, you might have trouble justifying right now. Don't worry too
hard about the justification!</p> 

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<li>Two very useful programs are called <code>ping</code> and <code>traceroute</code>. These are unfortunately disabled on campus. The first times how long it takes to send a packet to a remote host (as well as other things). The second traces the path between all physical devices that are used to transmit information between your computer and a remote host. Try them at home!
