<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Lab 4<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><code>malloc</code> - Memory Allocation</h2>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Operating systems provide functionality through the <i>system call</i>
mechanism. System calls tend to be low-level routines that are closely tied
to basic system functionality. To make these features more usable, higher level
<i>system libraries</i> implement higher-level abstractions. For example, consider
the difference between <code>write()</code> and <code>printf()</code>. For this
assignment you will take on the role of a system library developer and implement
your own version of the C memory allocation routine- <code>malloc()</code>.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write your own memory allocation routines - <code>malloc()</code> , <code>free()</code>, <code>calloc()</code>, and <code>realloc()</code>
<li>Use the <code>sbrk()</code> system call to request memory from the operating system
<li>Track allocated chunks of memory with a linked list
<li>Compile and link other programs to your own allocator
</ol>

<p><h3>Parameters</h3></p>

<p>This is a solo assignment. Please do not collaborate with other students on this
assignment.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Functions:</h3></p>

<p><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;</code><br>
<code>void *malloc( size_t size );</code><br>
<code>void free( void *ptr );</code><br>
<code>void *calloc( size_t num_of_elts, size_t elt_size );</code><br>
<code>void *realloc( void *pointer, size_t size);</code></p>

<p><h3>Usage:</h3></p>

<p>Link or compile any C/C++ program.</p>


<p><h3>Description</h3></p>

<p>
This is an individual assignment. You must write this in C (use the gcc compiler), not in C++.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this assignment is to replace the memory allocation routines that
are provided by the C/C++ standard library. The <code>malloc</code> function is called by
programmers to request a contiguous block of memory. The <code>free</code> function frees
a block of memory previously allocated, so it can be reused. The <code>calloc</code> and
realloc functions are minor variants of <code>malloc</code>.
</p>

<p>
Read the man page for these functions for more details. In particular, <code>size_t</code>
is defined in the include file <code>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</code> and you can treat it like any other
integer type.
</p>

<p>
You are to create a file which contains code implementing the C library functions
<code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>realloc</code>, <code>calloc</code>. 
This is not a complete program, so you'll need to write test programs as well.
</p>

<p>
<code>malloc</code> should maintain a list of free memory blocks and fill incoming requests
for memory from the list. When searching the free list for a block of suffcient
size, use the first-fit method. If no large enough block is found, create a new
free block by calling <code>sbrk()</code>. The new free block should be a multiple of the
system page size, and large enough to fill the request. If <code>sbrk()</code> fails, set 
<code>errno</code> to <code>ENOMEM</code> and return <code>NULL</code>, as described in 
the <code>malloc</code> man page.
</p>

<p>
If the requested block is smaller than the found free block, you'll need to split
the free block into two pieces: one that stays on the free list, and one that
<code>malloc</code> can return.
</p>

<p>
<code>malloc</code> should always return values that are divisible by 8 (long word aligned).
</p>

<p>
The <code>free</code> function frees memory allocated by malloc. It should simply add the
block back onto the free list. If <code>free</code> is called with a <code>NULL</code> pointer, it returns. If
<code>free</code> is called with a pointer not allocated by <code>malloc</code>, the results are undefined.
It would be nice if <code>free</code> combined adjacent free blocks, but that is not required.
</p>



<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>

<p>
Start by writing (or gathering) programs that call <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, etc. 
Make sure you understand what they do, and test them with the built in <code>malloc</code>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Call your functions <code>mymalloc</code>, <code>myfree</code>, <code>myrealloc</code>, and <code>mycalloc</code> until you're
really, really sure everything works. Once you rename them <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, etc.,
they get called by constructors, by stream I/O, and in all sorts of places that
will cause programs to fail utterly if the memory functions aren't working. This
is the reason you are required to use C rather than C++ for this assignment.
</p>

<p>
Write <code>mymalloc</code> first and test it thoroughly before attempting the other three
functions. Test these functions by writing a separate program which has a
<code>main()</code> and makes calls to <code>mymalloc</code>, <code>myfree</code>, etc. In your test program, you'll
need to declare <code>mymalloc</code>, <code>myfree</code>, ... as <code>extern</code> functions.
</p>

<p>
To write <code>malloc</code>, use a global variable to keep track of the first block on the
linked list of free blocks. At the beginning of each block of memory, leave extra
space for a structure that contains the size of the block and a pointer to the
next block in linked list. (Use a doubly linked list if you prefer.)
</p>

<p>
Use <code>sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)</code> to find the system's page size when you need to
request new memory from the system.
</p>

<p>
Since blocks need to be long word aligned, you'll need to be able to round a
number up to the nearest multiple of 8. This is surprisingly tricky. Write a
function to do this and test it separately.
</p>

<p>Here is a sample "bad" version of malloc that works, but conforms to very few of the
specifications given: <a href="bad_malloc.c">bad_malloc.c</a>.

<p>
Once you're _really_ sure <code>malloc</code> is working, write <code>free</code>. Test some more, and then
finally write <code>realloc</code> and <code>calloc</code>. The <code>calloc</code> function should call <code>malloc</code> and
then call <code>memset</code> to clear the newly allocated block. The <code>realloc</code> function
should call <code>malloc</code> to make a new block, <code>memcpy</code> to move the old information
into the new block, and then <code>free</code> to release the old block. Beware that in
<code>realloc</code>, the block can be resized larger or smaller, and the number of bytes
you copy is the smaller of the old and new sizes.
</p>

<p>
When you're sure everything is working, rename your functions <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>,
<code>realloc</code>, <code>calloc</code>. If you now compile any program along with your malloc.c,
they will get called instead of the standard C/C++ memory allocators.
</p>

<p>
I use the programs <code><a href="churn.c">churn.c</a></code> and <code><a href="churn2.c">churn2.c</a></code> to
heavily test your memory allocators. Feel free to test your functions with these programs as well.

<p><h3>Submission</h3></p>

<p>Please submit your code in your git repository under the Lab_4 directory.</p>

<!--
<p>Create a .tgz archive of your lab directory and email it to
<code><big><b>dferry_submit@slu.edu</b></big></code>.
Your submission must contain a file <code>malloc.c</code>
which contains definitions for <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>,
<code>realloc</code>, <code>calloc</code> but has no <code>main()</code>
and with all output (<code>cout</code>, <code>printf</code>) removed.

<p>The simple syntax for creating a .tgz archive is as follows:</p>

<p><code>tar -zvcf new_archive.tgz lab_directory</code></p>

<p>The syntax for unpacking a .tgz archive is:</p>

<p><code>tar -zvxf archive.tgz</code></p>

<p>Note that your archive <b>must not</b> include any binary executable files,
meaning any compiled programs or intermediate build objects (.o files, for
example). This will cause your email to be rejected by most services.</p>
