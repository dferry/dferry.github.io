<h3>What is encryption?</h3>

<p>Encryption is the act of converting a <i>plain-text</i> message into an
enciphered <i>cipher-text</i> that is (supposed to be) unreadable by 
adversaries or other unauthorized persons. Encryption is a basic building
block of our digital lives: every time you visit a secure website such as
your bank, online merchants, or school email that connection is encrypted.
This means that the web page you see actually goes through a four-step
process before it shows up on your screen:</p>

<ol>
<li>You visit a website like <a href="amazon.com">amazon.com</a>
<li>The web server generates the web page you are supposed to see (which is
not the same for everyone, for example amazon.com includes specific
reccomendations based on your purchase history) and then encrypts it
<li>The web page is sent across the internet in encrypted form
<li>Your computer recieves the encrypted page and decrypts it before
displaying the contents on your screen
</ol>

<p>Because this communication is encrypted it means that nobody else can
read that data as it is moving through the internet. (Sending an unecrypted
website would be like sending a letter through the mail without an envelope-
anyone who handled it could easily see what the contents were.) This means
that any sensitive data: your bank account balance, your credit card number,
your Amazon reccomendations, etc. are all hidden from anyone who might be
watching. However, encryption is used in many other domains as well:
governments, businesses, and militaries use encryption frequently to
ensure that their messages are only seen by the people who are intended
to see them.</p>

<h3>Goal today:</h3>

<p>Our goal today is to implement two different encryption algorithms: the
first is an ancient technique called a Ceasar Cipher, and the second uses
MATLAB's random numbers to create a more secure
encoding. A Ceasar Cipher isn't going to fool anybody, and in fact these are
commonly used as puzzles for kids and adults. Our second encryption method
isn't going to fool anyone who knows what they're doing 
(e.g. the <a href="nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a>) but would probably
be good enough to keep secrets from my Mother (who is not a computer person
at all). 

<p>Computationally we can view both encryption methods as a function that
takes three parameters: an input file, an output file, and an encryption
key. The encryption key is a secret that is shared between the sender and
reciever of a secret message so they can encode and decode the message
properly. Anybody with the correct encryption key and a copy of your
ciphertext will be able to read your messages.</p>

<h3>Test File</h3>

<p>We will use the following file as a test case for our encryption routines,
a copy of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy from the Gutenberg Project:
<a href="warpeace.txt">warpeace.txt</a></p>

<h3>Ceasar Ciphers</h3>

<p>The Caesar Cipher, named after the Roman emperor Julius Caesar, shifts
each letter of a message up or down by a fixed offset. For example, if we
wanted to encrypt the word "apple" with an offset of "+3" then we get:</p>

<pre>
Key:    +3
Input:  apple
Output: dssoh
</pre>

<p>If a letter is close to the end of the alphabet then we can wrap-around
to the start of the alpabet. For example, we can encrypt:</p>

<pre>
Key:    +5
Input:  xylophone
Output: cdqtumtsj
</pre>

<p>Where X goes to C because we count up to Z, and then start at A again.</p>


<h3>Random-shift Cipher</h3>

<p>One major limitation of the Caesar Cipher is that a given input
letter will always be mapped to a given output letter under a specific key.
For example, when we encrypt "apple" above both of the P characters are
encoded as S. This means anybody with some patience and a little cleverness
can crack these ciphers easily. It would be far stronger if our encoding did
not have this property. For example suppose we could do a custom offset for
each letter:</p>

<pre>
Offsets: 3 5 2 7 4
Input:   A P P L E
Output:  D U R S I
</pre>

<p>However, the values we use for offsets must be non-obvious but predictable
if we have the right encryption key. We can satisfy both of these requirements
with MATLAB's random number generator.</p>
