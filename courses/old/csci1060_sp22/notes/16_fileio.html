<h2><a name="file">Overview of File I/O</a></h2>

When reading or writing large amounts of data, it is often much more
convenient to interact with files.  There are two basic approaches to
working with files.  MATLAB has built-in support for reading or
writing using many common high-level file formats (e.g., Excel files,
comma-separated values, XML, WAV, AVI, and much more).   It also
provides low-level support for reading from or writing to files one
character at a time.

<h2><a name="lowlevelFiles">Low-Level File I/O</a></h2>


<h3><a name="open">Opening a File</a></h3>

The first step to reading or writing a file is to formally open the
file from within MATLAB.  This is done using a call of the form
<b><tt>fopen(filename,&nbsp;permission)</tt></b> where
<ul>
  <li>
      <b><tt>filename</tt></b> is a string that represents the filename on
      the system.  By default, this is in the current working
      directory, but a full path can be used to specify a file
      elsewhere on the system.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <b><tt>permissions</tt></b> is a string chosen from the following designators:
      <ul>
	<li>
	    <tt>'r'</tt>
	    for reading only
	</li>
	<li>
	    <tt>'w'</tt>
	    for writing only
	</li>
	<li>
	    <tt>'a'</tt>
	    for appending only
	</li>
	<li>
	    <tt>'r+'</tt>
	    for both reading and writing
	</li>
      </ul>

      By default, if the caller does not send a permission designator,
      <tt>'r'</tt> is assumed.
  </li>

</ul>



<h3><a name="fid">File Identifiers</a></h3>

<p>
Since a program might open several files simulatneously for different
purposes, there must be a way to keep track of which file is which for
further commands.  MATLAB does this by using unique integer known
as a <em>file identifier</em>.   The call to <tt>fopen</tt> sends back
this ID as a return value.  So a typical syntax for opening a file
would be
<pre>
fid = fopen('sample.txt');           % opens the file for reading
</pre>
We can later use that ID value with other file operations (e.g.,
<tt>fprintf</tt>, <tt>fscanf</tt>, <tt>fclose</tt>).

<p>
It is possible that the call to <tt>fopen</tt> fails to properly open
the file, either because it cannot be found or because the user does
not have the necessary permissions for accessing the file in that
way.  In this case, the call to <tt>fopen</tt> returns the value
<tt>-1</tt> as a result, and in fact, returns an error message as a
second return value.  The program can then look for that as a signal
of a problem.  For example, here is an example from the MATLAB
docuemntation that promps a user for the name of a file to
open, repeating until successful.
<pre>
fid=0;
while fid < 1
   filename=input('Open file: ', 's');
   [fid,message] = fopen(filename, 'r');
   if fid == -1
     disp(message)
   end
end
</pre>


<p>
MATLAB also uses certain IDs for some standard file-like objects
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>fid</th>
    <th>purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>standard input</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>standard output</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>standard error</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h3><a name="closing">Closing a File</a></h3>

<p>
When you are finished accessing an open file, you should close it by
calling <tt>fclose(fid)</tt> using the appropriate file
identifier. This ensures that the file is properly saved and it frees
us the numeric identifier for reuse.  You may also use the syntax
<tt>fclose('all')</tt> to close all open files (other than the
"standard" filelike objects).


<h3><a name="writing">Writing to a File</a></h3>

<p>
Once a file has been opened for writing, we can use <tt>fprintf</tt>
to write text to it.   By default, a command such as <tt>fprintf('Hello\n')</tt>
sends the characters to the <em>standard output</em>.  But we can send
those characters to an open file by giving the file identifier as a
first parameter. As an example, here is a small script that creates a
new text file.
<pre>
fid = fopen('sample.txt', 'w');      % opens file sample.txt for writing
fprintf(fid, 'Hello\n');             % writes to that file, based on identifier fid
fclose(fid);                         % closes and saves the file
</pre>


<h3><a name="reading">Reading from a File</a></h3>

<p>
There are several functions for reading from a file.

<p>
<b><tt>data = fread(fid)</tt></b>
<br>
This reads the entire remainder of the open file into a string.

<p>
<b><tt>data = fread(fid, n)</tt></b>
<br>
This reads a maximum of the next <tt>n</tt> bytes of the open file.


<p>
<b><tt>line = fgetl(fid)</tt></b>
<br>
Reads the next line from the file and returns that line (but without
the ending newline character) as a result.

<p>
<b><tt>line = fgets(fid)</tt></b>
<br>
Almost identical to <tt>fgetl</tt>, but the returned string for this
form includes the ending newline character (if any).


<p>
<b><tt>fscanf</tt></b> is the most versatile function for reading
formatted data from an open file.  It uses formatting strings in a way
reminiscent of the way <tt>fprintf</tt> is used to write to a file.
Most notably, it uses <tt>%s</tt> to read a string (delimited by
whitespace), <tt>%d</tt> to read an integer, and <tt>%g</tt> to read a
floating-point value.

<p>
Furthermore, <tt>fscanf</tt> is vectorized in the sense that the call
<tt>fscanf(fid,&nbsp;'%d')</tt> will not just read a single integer,
but will attempt to read as many integers as it can until reaching a
portion of the file that does not match an integer format.  Those
integers will be returned as a vector.

<p>
If you want to limit the scan to a maximum number of elements to read,
you can specify that limit as a third element.  For example,
<tt>fscanf(fid,&nbsp;'%d',&nbsp;1)</tt> will only attempt to read the
next integer.



<h3><a name="position">Position within a file</a></h3>

<p>
When a file is open, MATLAB internally maintains the position at which
it is currently reading or writing. This is essentially like the cursor
in a word processor. When initially opened for reading
or writing, the position is at the beginning of the file (or when
opened for appending, the position is at the end of the file).

<p>
We can query the current position using the syntax
<pre>
position = ftell(fid)
</pre>
where position measures the number of bytes from the beginning of the
file (with -1 returned when the file is not properly opened).

<p>
It is also posible to reposition the current cursor using a syntax
<pre>
fseek(fid, offset, origin)
</pre>
where <tt>offset</tt> is a number that can be positive or negative, and
<tt>origin</tt> is a string designate the frame of reference for the
seek, as
<ul>
  <li>
      <tt>'bof'</tt> to measure from beginning of file
  </li>
  <li>
      <tt>'cof'</tt> to measure from current position of file
  </li>
  <li>
      <tt>'eof'</tt> to measure from end of file
  </li>
</ul>

      <p>
      <b><tt>load('myData.mat')</tt></b>
      <br>
      Loads varaibles into the current workspace, that were previously saved using the save command.
