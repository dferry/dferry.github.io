<H2>Working with image data</H2>

<p>Images are typically stored as a set of pixels. Each pixel
represents the color of a specific dot of the image.
Loading a standard image into MATLAB is easy, for example loading
the image above into MATLAB is done with: 

<pre>
image = imread('slu.png');
</pre>

<p>The <tt>slu.png</tt> image has 600 pixel rows and 800 pixel columns, so the
above command generates a three-dimensional matrix of size 600x400x3. (Each pixel
is stored with a red, green, and blue channel, so the third dimension is 3.)
For example, the command:

<pre>
image(123,234,3)
</pre>

<p>accesses the blue channel of the pixel in the 123rd row of the picture and the 234th
column of the picture.</p>
