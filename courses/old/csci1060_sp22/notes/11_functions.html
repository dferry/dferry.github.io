Notes 10: Functions
</H2>

<HR>

We have used many of MATLAB's functions.   We can create our own
functions as well. There are many advantages to
organizing our operations within a function.
<ul>
  <li>
      It provides another form of repetition.  While loops can provide
      immediate repetions of a piece of code, a function encapsulate a
      piece of code that can be called intermittently.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      Use of a function allows us to get needed results without
      polluting the workspace with irrelevant variables from
      intermediate calculations.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      Encapsulating complex calculations within a function makes the
      primary piece of code more legible.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
We will examine two approaches for defining functions:  anonymous
functions and stored functions.

<hr>

<h3>Anonymous Functions</h3>

General syntax uses a format
<pre>
<em>fhandle = @(arglist) expr</em>
</pre>

<p>
As a concrete example, here is an anonymous function that computes
the volume of a cylinder with a known height and radius.
<pre>
cylinder = @(height, radius) pi * radius^2 * height;
</pre>
After defining this function, we may call it as
<pre>
v = cylinder(5, 3);   % returns 141.37
</pre>

<h4>limitations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
      The returned value must be expressible as a single expression on
      the remainder of the line.  Although if clever, you can sneak in
      a bit of control structures such as the following.
      <pre>
      mymax = @(a, b) if a > b a else b end;
      </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
      Extra care is needed if returning more than one value (although
      it is easy to return a value that is a vector of other values).
  </li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h3>Stored Functions</h3>

<p>
While an anonymous function can be called from elsewhere within the
file, it cannot be reused from other files.

To make a function for more general use, it must be named and stored
in an m-file based upon that name.

<p>
As an example, here is a function that computes the volume of a
cylinder, given the height and radius.
<pre>
function volume = cylinder(height, radius)
% function to compute the volume of a cylinder
% Usage:  volume = cylinder(height, radius)
  base = pi * radius^2;
  volume = base * height;        % the final answer
</pre>

With this file in the current directory, it can be called from
elsewhere using the syntax <tt>cylinder(h,&nbsp;r)</tt> for parameters
<tt>h</tt> and <tt>r</tt>.

<h4>Returning multiple values</h4>
<pre>
function [area, volume]  = cylinder(height, radius)
% function to compute the surface area and volume of a cylinder
% Usage:  [area, volume] = cylinder(height, radius)
  base = pi * radius^2;
  volume = base * height;                        % the second result
  area = 2 * pi * radius * height + 2 * base;    % the first result
</pre>

<p>
The caller can retrieve both values using whatever variable names they
want.
<pre>
[a v] = cylinder(5, 3);
</pre>
The caller can also choose to accept only some of the return values,
but in that case, the number of returned values will be selected from
left to right.  It does not matter what variable name is used.
<pre>
v = cylinder(5, 3);     % WILL BE THE AREA
</pre>



<h4>Being aware of the number of arguments sent by caller</h4>

We can determine the number of parameters passed in with the keyword
<tt>nargin</tt>.

<pre>
function volume = cylinder(height, radius)
% function to compute the volume of a cylinder
% Usage:  volume = cylinder(height, radius)
%
% If not specified, radius is assumed to be 1        
  if nargin == 1
    radius = 1;                  % default value for second parameter
  end
  base = pi * radius^2;
  volume = base * height;        % the final answer
</pre>

<h4>Being aware of the number of return values being caputred by caller</h4>

We can determine the number of captured return values, with the 
keyword <tt>nargout</tt>.  We can use this knowledge to avoid
unnecessary work.
<pre>
function [area, volume]  = cylinder(height, radius)
% function to compute the surface area and volume of a cylinder
% Usage:  [area, volume] = cylinder(height, radius)
%
% If not specified, radius is assumed to be 1        
  if nargin == 1
    radius = 1;                  % default value for second parameter
  end
  base = pi * radius^2;
  area = 2 * pi * radius * height + 2 * base;    % the first result
  if nargout == 2
    volume = base * height;                      % the second result
  end
</pre>


<h4>Writing vectorized functions</h4>

What if we wanted the above to work for a vector of heights and a
vector of radius? 

<pre>
function [area, volume]  = cylinder(height, radius)
% function to compute the surface area and volume of a cylinder
% Usage:  [area, volume] = cylinder(height, radius)
%
% If parameters are vectors of equal length, or if one parameter is a
% scalar and the other is a vector, this returns a corresponding
% vector of areas and a vector of volumes.
%
% If not specified, radius is assumed to be 1        
  if nargin == 1
    radius = 1;                 % default value for second parameter
  end
  base = pi .* radius.^2;
  area = 2 .* pi .* radius .* height + 2 .* base;    % the first result
  if nargout == 2
    volume = base .* height;                         % the second result
  end
</pre>


<h4>Subfunctions</h4>

You can define several functions in the same m-file, with the first
one being the publically available one, and the others being used
privately to support the first.

<hr>

<h3><a name="peaks">Case Study: Finding the Maximum Iteratively</a></h3>

<p>
Given a vector, we have discussed the basic algorithm for finding the
maximum, by keep track of the maximum thus far while iterating through
the vector.

<p>
Question: how many different elements qualify as being the 
maximum thus far during that process?

<p>
Goal: Develop a function <tt>peaks(v)</tt> that returns the number of
elements that have value surpassing all previous elements in the vector.
For example, <nobr><tt>peaks([5 1 8 3 8 11 10])</tt></nobr> should return
<tt>3</tt>, as the first element, the third element and the sixth
elements are new maximums (we do not count the fifth, because that
value 8 did not surpass the previously visited maximum of 8).


<p>
Goal: Rewrite the function so that it can provide a second return
value, which is a vector of indices achieving those peaks (akin to the
second return value of the built-in <tt>max</tt> function).  Thus
<nobr><tt>peaks([5 1 8 3 8 11 10])</tt></nobr> should return the pair
<nobr><tt>[ 3  [1 3 6] ]</tt></nobr>.
