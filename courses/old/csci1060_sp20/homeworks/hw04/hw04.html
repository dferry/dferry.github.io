<p>
For this assignment, <b>you are allowed to work with one other
student</b> if you wish (in fact, we suggest that you do so).
If any student wishes to have a partner but
has not been able to locate one, please let the instructor know so
that we can match up partners.   One member of the partnership should
submit the final code, making sure that all members' names are
included as part of comments at the beginning of each file.

<p>Submit your work via the git repository.</p>

For this assignment, we will be revisiting the stock market data
introduced in the previous assignment.  This time, rather than
plotting the data graphically, we will be performing various numerical
analyses.
As a reminder, the data (<a
href="djia.txt">download here</a>) has one row for each day
of market activity.  It is arranged in columns that designate
<br>

<table border=1>

    <th>Month</th>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Daily Opening Price</th>

<p>
Please be aware of the following issues:
<ul>
  <li>
      The table only contains data for days that the market was open
      for trading; there are no entries for weekends and
      holidays. The significance of this fact is that if you are
      looking for the first "day" of a month it will not necessarily
      have date 1.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      Although it may often be the case that one day's closing price
      is equal to the following market day's opening price, this is
      not necessarily the case.   For all of the problems below, we
      will be very clear as to when you should be using opening, high,
      low, or closing prices for the analyses.  Please be careful to
      use the proper column indices.
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="submit"><h2>Problems to be Submitted (20 points)</h2></a>

<p>
For this assignment, you should produce a single script named
<b><tt>dow.m</tt></b> that behaves as follows.  It should load the raw
data and then repeatedly offer the user a menu of possible analyses,
until the user chooses to quit.  The choices should be
<ul>
  <li>
      Best single month (% gain)
  </li>
  <li>
      Most consecutive days with gain
  </li>
  <li>
      Biggest historical downturn (% drop)
  </li>
  <li>
      Market trends
  </li>
  <li>
      Quit
  </li>
</ul>
You should use the built-in function <tt>menu</tt> to handle the user
I/O for selecting from this menu.  It is called using the syntax
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<nobr><tt>userSelection = menu(title, choice1, choice2, ...);</tt></nobr>
<br>
where the parameters are strings to be displayed and the returned
value is the index of the selected choice.  Type
<tt>help&nbsp;menu</tt> for documentation.

<p>
In the remainder of this assignment description, we describe the 
requirements for the four types of analyses.

<h3>Best Single Month (% gain)</h3>

<p>
Consider each calendar month in the data set (e.g., September 2007).  For
a particular month, take the ratio between the
<em>closing price on the last market day of the month</em> and
the <em>opening price on the first market day of the month</em>.  The
gain is computed as that ratio, minus one, then multiplied by 100.
You are to determine the calendar month with the highest percentage
gain on record.

Output your results using a format such as
<pre>
Opening price on 2007/09/04 was 13358.39
Closing price on 2007/09/28 was 13895.63
That is a gain of 4.02%.
</pre>
(but this is not actually the best month)


<h3>Most Consecutive Days with Gain</h3>

<p>
Consider a day as having gain if the closing price for the
day is strictly greater than the opening price for that same day.  You
are to determine the longest streak of daily gains for the history of
the market.

Output your results using a format such as
<pre>
There were 5 consecutive days of gain
starting on 2008/11/21 and continuing through 2008/11/28.
</pre>
(but this is not actually the longest streak)



<h3>Biggest Historical Downturn (% drop)</h3>

<p>
After the housing crsis and market crash the value of the
stock market dropped about 50% of what it previously was.
But this is not the worst such percentage drop in history.  
Determine
the largest such drop, namely a low point that is the smallest
percentage when compared to a preceding high point.
More formally, you are looking for the days <em>a</em>
and <em>b</em> with <em>a&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;b</em> chronologically so as to minimize
the ratio of <nobr><em>low(b) / high(a)</em></nobr>. Output your
results using a format such as
<pre>
High price on 2007/10/11 was 14279.96.
Low price on 2008/11/21 was 7392.27.
That is 51.77% of the previous high.
</pre>
(but this is not actually the largest percentage drop)


<p>
Make sure to consider the efficiency of your approach. Given the size
of the data set, there are over 200 million pairs of the form
<em>a&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;b</em>.  You do not want to do the computation in
a brute force manner over all such pairs.  Think about how to
streamline the search for the solution.


<h3>Market Trends</h3>

<p>
In this problem, we examine some historical trends in the market.  In
particular, there is reason to believe that market activity is
different on the very last market day of a year, or the very first
market day of a year, because some people may time their trades due to
tax considerations.

<p>
To test the hypothesis, we want to compute the <em>geometric mean</em>
of the daily percentage change taken over three sample sets
<ul>
  <li>
      All yearly first market days
  </li>
  <li>
      All yearly last market days
  </li>
  <li>
      All market days
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean">geometric
mean</a> is computed as follows.  For a day in the sample, 
compute the daily percentage change as
<em>close(day)/open(day)</em>.   For all days in a given sample,
compute the product of those ratios and then take the n<small><sup>th</sup></small>
root of the product, where <em>n</em> is the number of samples.  Note
that the n<small><sup>th</sup></small> root can be computed by raising
the product to the (1/n) power. 



<p>
Output your results using the format
<pre>
Day type          Geometric Mean
-------------     --------------
first of year         ?.??????
last of year          ?.??????
typical               ?.??????
</pre>
of course, you should replace the question marks with the actual
answers. Show six significant digits in the result.


<hr>

<a name="extra"><h2>Extra Credit (2 points)</h2></a>

<p>
The initial analysis of market trends shows that the first and last
day of the year are slightly better than average.  So the next
interesting question is what is the absolute best calendar date using
the historical data.

<p>
Add an extra option to the menu that does a daily analysis.  This
should internally compute the geometric mean for every possible
calendar day (e.g., geometric mean for the set of all Jan.&nbsp;1,
geometric mean for the set of all Jan.&nbsp;2).  Then report which day
produces the highest such mean using the form
<pre>
Best historic date is MM/DD with geometric mean ?.??????.
</pre>

<p>
Advice:  One way to approach this problem is to compile statistics
using 12-by-31 arrays that can be indexed by <em>(month,date)</em>
pairs.  Make a pass through the entire data set compiling the statistics
for building the geometric means.   The final challenge is
to learn how <tt>max</tt> works with arrays, so that you can find
out what the maximum geometric mean is and also what month and date it
corresponds to (see <tt>help&nbsp;max</tt> for more information, or
feel free to come ask me).

<p>
A second approach would be to use loops to iterate over all possible
calendar days, and then for a specific one to pull out all entries of
the data set that match that MM/DD, computing the geometric mean for
those entries, and then tracking the highest such mean as you go.  For
this approach, the <tt>find</tt> function can be useful.

<p>
Good luck!
