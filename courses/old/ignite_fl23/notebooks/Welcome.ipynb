The number passed to `forward()` controls the length Taylor walks, but that number doesn't have any real meaning- it's not millimeters or pixels or anything else... just experiment and you'll get a feel for it. Taylor also understands the commands `left()` and `right()`. These cause Taylor to turn left or right by the specified number of degrees. For example, `right(90)` causes Taylor to make a perfect right turn. Taylor also understands `backward()`, which works the same as `forward()`.\n",
