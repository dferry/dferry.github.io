Class: Chapter 1 - The Most Human Human - Discussion

* Start class with a 5 minute (full 5 minute) conversation with random classmate
	- This is an analog of the turing test, except you know the other person is human
	- What topics were talked about?

Major chapter topics:
* The Turing Test
	- Predicted 30% of people would be fooled by a 5 minute conversation in the year 2000
	- Reshapes our sense of self- are machines intelligent? What does that mean for us?
	- We're always doing the during test- 97% of email (and other digital communications?) are spam

* The Shrinking Human Domain
	- "Today it is the human computer that is relegated to the illegitimacy of the figurative." 
	- The specific "sentence" that all biologists, linguists, social scientists, etc. write:
		- "Humans are the only creatures that..."
		- Animals are a counterpoint beyond computers:
			The use tools, language, show ability to reason, do rational decision making, etc., 
			all are different criteria people have proposed as being "uniquely human". 
		- Does the fact that a bird uses tools devalue the human ability to use tools?

* How do we react to our reduction of uniqueness?
	- Is this actually bad? Are we just assuming it is bad?
	- Does expanded computer ability mean we free up ourselves to do more of the human stuff?
		-E.g. Were human computers really doing engaging human work?
	- Does it really devalue human activity when we make a machine do it?
		-If so, does an inability for computers to match human achievements somehow amplify those achievements?
		 E.g. if a computer can't make art, does it make artists more special?
	- Why do we assume humans are unique and special in the first place?
		-Is it good for our concept of uniqueness to be reactionary in this way?
	
* Does the Turing Test really test intelligence?
	- Turing test might pass because machines got really smart, or...
	- Maybe humans are just bad at being human. Past Turing Test transcripts show a lot of very banal discussion.
	- What it does do is hold a mirror up to ourselves:
		-Think of machines as rivals, not terminator-like nemeses
		-The Turing Test shows humans how to be more human
			-Programmers have to understand this to be successful
			-"Knowing our enemy becomes a way of knowing ourselves."


* Rationality of Birds:
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.2386

	- Reported violations of rationality in humans
		- Circular preferences (intransitivity)
		- Lack of independence of irrelevant alternatives
