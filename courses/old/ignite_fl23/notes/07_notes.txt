Chapter 4 - Site-Specificity vs. Pure Technique

* Chapter Topics:
  - ELIZA
  - Scaling Therapy (Psychology without Psychologists)
  - Reacting Locally (Give people a checklist and they loose half their IQ,
    give people authority and trust them and they double their IQ)
  - A Robot Will Be Doing Your Job (human jobs, then mechanization, then
    automation)
  - "I Can't Communicate" (Site-specificity and context vs. Pure Technique
    in communication, an examination of customer service and similar
    communication roles in the modern world)
  - Maggot Therapy (AI and automation show us what is truly human, rather
    than taking away human activity)
  - Art Cannot be Scaled (Artists get bored and continually challenge
    themselve, as soon as something is easy, a different challenge is taken)
  - Site-Specificity in Conversation (Good conversation is tailored to the
    audience, the speaker, the context, the location, etc. Consider the
    professional stage actor that has to literally recreate the same
    communication performance many times per week)

* Site-Specificity
  - Comes from architecture: Do you plan a new building with the specific
    site in mind, or not? Computer tools allow an architect to take the same
    basic building plan and tweak it to different sites.
  - Can be applied to any other endeavor, for example, Google the phrase
    site-specific art.
  - Another way of asking: Is this specific endeavor location-dependent or
    context-dependent? Do you lose something if you take away the specific
    location or the specific context? 
  - Aesthetically, window orientation is an example of site-specificity-
    a site might have great views in one or two directions. Technically,
    utilities, subsoil structure, other local conditions may need to be
    taken into account when building.
* Pure Technique
  - From Joseph Wizenbaum, a psychologist. It is providing psychotherapy
    while explicitly not getting into a patients' specific context or
    background. 
  - Explicitly **not** a method. Between method and method's opposite.
  - Pure technique can be described as a lack of "judgement," or "discovery"
    or "figuring out." 
  - The lack of site-specificity. An endeavor can be adequately mechanized
    into a list of instructions or a checklist that makes no mention of and
    is not concerned with location or other contextual factors.

* Site-Specificity vs. Pure Technique
  - Site-specificity sounds good, but is it always good? Is it always
    really what we want? 
    - Do you really want the cashier to have a long, 2-3 minute conversation
      with you every time you go to the store? What if you're the 5th person
      in line? 
    - What about a customer service rep on the phone?
    - What about a concierge?
    - When do you really want a custom, unique experience?
  - Pure technique
    - Removes complexity, judgement, and decision making from process
    - Comfort in pure technique
      - We don't want to think about every decision all the time (morning
        routine, think about the guy who couldn't pick between the wallet and
        the pen)
    - Allows processes to go faster
    - Allows processes to scale
      - Assembly lines are good examples of pure technique, we remove all
        decision making on purpose
      - Interchangeable parts vs. craftwork is another example, craftwork
        can be beautiful, unique, and individualized, but it costs much more,
        it takes a long time to produce, and it can't be fixed or repaired
        easily
 
* Human technique vs. mechanization vs. automation
  - Things never go from "human" to "AI automation"
  - They go from "human" to "mechanized" to "AI automation"
  - Mechanization means pure technique in the language of the chapter- the
    jobs have been reduced to a mindless checklist. This is precisely what has
    made the jobs capable of being automated
  - The middle step is where we drain the humanness and creativity from jobs
  - If robots, AI, and automation went away tomorrow, people would be doing
    mechanized jobs like they were robots
    - This does not mean these are not "good jobs," lots of people just want
      a good job with good benefits to provide for themselves
    - But, they are not jobs where people find intellectual value or creative
      value in the work itself
      - They can still find value in doing the work and providing the service
      - Takes us back to the big question: What is human work?

Class Activity:

0. Do now - what is your conception of Pure Technique, site specificity,
   and method?

1. Summarize site specificity vs. pure technique

2. Discussion: Therapy
   - Can a therapist do their work in a pure technique fashion?
   - Which would you prefer?

3. Summarize automation vs mechanization vs whatever else (human work)
   - If it can be mechanized, then it can be automated

4. Discussion: Mechanization
   - Who has worked in a mechanized job?
   - Teaching is arguably "Pure Technique"
     - Every textbook, tutorial, or other written work of teaching is arguably
       an implicit argument for the mechanization of teaching
     - And yet people keep going to teachers for some reason
   - Same argument for therapy- self-help books are mechanized therapy
     - Does being a "wounded healer" make a therapist a better therapist?
   
5. How far does mechanization, or pure technique, apply? Art, philosophy,
   science, etc? 
   - What jobs can be mechanized? 
   - How do tools help augment human creators rather than supplant them?
