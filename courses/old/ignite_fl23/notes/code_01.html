	<h2>Starting on a Chatbot</h2>
	<p>In this class, we will start building our own chat bot from scratch.
	This asks you to use everything we have learned so far on our programming
	days.</p>

	<p>Being a good programmer isn't about knowing how to write all the code
	you will never need to write! Veteran programmers get stuck all the time.
	The key to being a good programmer is knowing how to quickly and
	efficiently get yourself un-stuck.</p>

	<p>When you get stuck, go back to your Colab notebooks from previous
	days and use the code you wrote then as a template. You can always ask the
	instructor for help as well!</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Part 1 - Set up a new Colab Notebook for your project.</b></li>
		<p>Go to<code>colab.research.oogle.com</code>
		and create a new notebook. Give it a meaningful title. At the top of
		the notebook, create a text box that describes the contents of the
		notebook.</p>
		<li><b>Part 2 - Start with a minimum working product.</b></li>
		<p>Any software is written as an iterative process. Think about what
		is the smallest and easiest functionality you will want to implement
		in your project. Then, build that easiest piece first, even if it
		is just a single line of code. Then, stop and test your code
		completely until you are satisfied it is always correct.</p>
		<p>For this project, the smallest and easiest function will be for
		your chatbot to print a statement welcoming the user and asking them
		what they would like to say. Create a code box, if you have not already,
		and write a line of code that does that. Then, test your code by
		running it to confirm it works correctly.</p>
		<p>Refer to "Getting Python to Talk" if you want a refresher on how to
		have Python produce output.</p>
		<li><b>Part 3 - Iterate on the program.</b></li>
		<p>Once you have a working set of features done, 
		start over by thinking about the next smallest or
		easiest functionality and repeat the cycle.</p>
		<p>For us, the next feature we would like to add is to accept input
		from the user. Your program should print out the user's input to confirm
		that it was accepted correctly.
		</p>
		<p>Refer to "Conditional Responses" for a refresher on how to have Python
		accept input.</p>
		<li><b>Part 4 - Start providing tailored responses</b></li>
		<p>When your program accepts input, it should make a response rather
		than just repeating the user's input back to them. Inspect the user
		input for at least five key words, and provide a tailored output
		for each of them. For example, if the user input includes the
		word "computer," your bot could respond by saying, "I'm not a computer,
		why would you think that?"</p>
		<p>Refer to "Conditional Responses" for a refresher on how to search
		input and provide a tailored response.</p>
		<li><b>Part 5 - Provide a generic catch-all response</b></li>
		<p>If the user input does not include a keyword corresponding to
		a specific tailored response, then it should provide a generic response
		that is suitable for any input but not specific to any input.</p>
		<p>This is a good feature for the else clause in an if-elseif-else
		statement, but that is by no means the only way to implement this feature.
		Refer to "Conditional Responses" for a refresher on the if-elseif-else
		statement.</p>
		<li><b>Part 6 - Have the conversation keep going</b></li>
		<p>Rather than having just one input each time you press the button to
		run your code, your chat bot should keep talking until you tell it you
		are done. Use a loop from last time to have your bot exchange multiple
		statements in a single session.</p>
		<p>Remember, if your bot gets stuck in an infinite loop you can use the
		stop button to terminate it.</p>
		<p>Refer to "Shall we Play a Game?" for a refresher on loops.
		<li><b>Part 7 - Quit the conversation</b></li>
		<p>Add an extra tailored response keyword such as "bye" or "quit" that
		causes your bot to stop executing the loop and terminate.  
		You can use the <code>break</code> keyword
		for this purpose. We used the
		<code>break</code> keyword at the end of "Shall we Play a Game?" to
		terminate a loop on command.</p>
		<p>When you provide the appropriate keyword, your bot should acknowledge
		the end of the conversation, execute the <code>break</code> statement,
		and finish the code block.</p>
		<li><b>Part 8 - Keep Iterating!</b></li>
		<p>You now have a basic working chat bot! Fleshing out additional
		conversation topics can be done entirely with the code we have
		developed above. Start by having a conversation with your chat bot,
		or by having a partner have a conversation, and think of some improvements
		that (1) you would like to make, and (2) you know how to make.
		For example, note down some additional keywords that you want to handle with
		tailored responses, and then do so.</p>
		<p>When you would like, take a look at the challenge options below.</p>
		
		<li><b>Challenge - Multiple Keywords</b></li>
		<p>Try implementing tailored response keywords that require two or
		more specific keywords. For example, an input that contains the words
		"good" and "weather" is likely expressing something very different
		from an input containing the words "bad" and "weather."

		<li><b>Challenge - Branching Conversation Trees</b></li>
		<p>Some user inputs might prompt your chat bot to ask its own question,
		or the chat bot output might depend on more than one input. Try using
		an if-statement inside an if-statement to provide some context-dependent
		responses.</p>

		<p>For example, think about how your code might generate the following
		two conversations.</p>

		<p><b>Conversation 1</b><br>
		<b>Human:</b> I love The Eagles!<br>
		<b>Response:</b> Hotel California is one of my favorite songs!
		</p>

		<p><b>Conversation 2</b><br>
		<b>Human:</b> Do you like the Lord of the Rings?<br>
		<b>Response:</b> I love it!<br>
		<b>Human:</b> Why didn't Frodo and Sam just ride the Eagles to Mordor?<br>
		<b>Response:</b> This conversation is over. Never talk to me again.
		</p>

		<li><b>Challenge - Memory</b></li>
		<p>Use one or more variables to get your chatbot to remember specific
		things that the user has said. For example, try to remember their name
		and then work that name into conversation responses.</p>
