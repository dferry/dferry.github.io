<a name="submit"><h3>Reflection Prompt</h3></a>

<P>
Your goal is to consider a set of possible topics you might be interested in, but also to think about how those
topics can translate into specific research questions. This reflection requires you to identify topic areas,
then high-level questions within those topic areas, and finally concrete research questions.
</P>

<p>We created a concept map in class. Feel free to use that as a starting point for finding topics and questions, 
but you can come up with other topics as well.</p>

<p>Specifically, you are required to:
<ul>
	<li>Come up with three general topic areas you are interested in</li>
	<li>For each topic area, give two high-level questions that relate to the topic area</li>
	<li>For each high-level question, give three concrete research questions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Topic areas</b> should be single words or short descriptions. They encompass a broad field of inquiry.
For example: neuroscience, sports medicine, or fashion design.</p>

<p><b>High-level questions</b> are important questions that can't be answered simply or shortly. Frequently such
questions will not admit a short "yes/no" answer or may be subjective in nature. For example, if my topic area
is sports medicine, then two high-level questions might be, "What are the health risks of playing professional
sports?" and, "How are athletes screened for potential injury?"</p>

<p><b>Concrete research questions</b> are are those that have a specific answer that can be uncovered through
finding and investigating sources. They typically can typically be answered conclusively with no room for
ambiguity, either through data or through expert testimony. These questions and answers form the basis of your
research project, and you will use a combination of such questions to attempt to shed light on the higher level
question you seek to answer. For example, if my high-level question is about the health risks of sports, then 
concrete research questions could be, "What injuries are most common in professional soccer players?" or,
or, "Which sports have the highest rate of injury?", or "How many athletes have to leave their sport due to permanent injury?"</p>

	<h3>Written Reflection Exercise</h3>

<p>You will need to identify 3 topic areas, 6 high-level questions, and 18 concrete questions. The format of
your reflection should be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Topic 1</li>
	<ul>
		<li>High-level Question 1</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete Question 1</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 2</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 3</li>
		</ul>
		<li>High-Level Question 2</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete Question 1</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 2</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 3</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Topic 2</li>
	<ul>
		<li>High-level Question 1</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete Question 1</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 2</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 3</li>
		</ul>
		<li>High-Level Question 2</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete Question 1</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 2</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 3</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Topic 3</li>
	<ul>
		<li>High-level Question 1</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete Question 1</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 2</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 3</li>
		</ul>
		<li>High-Level Question 2</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete Question 1</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 2</li>
			<li>Concrete Question 3</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
