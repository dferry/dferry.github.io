<h3><a name="Course Description">Course Description</a></h3>
What do you do when you discover that your operating system kernel doesn't
do what you need it to do? If you work in special-purpose domains, such as
real-time systems or high performance computing, you may find yourself wanting
to optimize bottlenecks or provide more deterministic timing guarantees. Or, if
you work in traditional OS domains such as scheduling or networking, you may
want to include new functionality in the kernel. Even if you never plan on
writing a line of kernel code outside of school, the kernel lies at the heart
of everything we do as computer scientists, so it's useful to have a deep
understanding of how userspace programs interact with kernel mechanisms.

<p>
The purpose of this course is for each student to:
<ul>
  <li>Develop a strong intuition about the operation of the kernel
  <li>Use tools to monitor and confirm what kernel mechanisms are actually doing
  <li>Gain hands-on experience in modifying kernel mechanisms so that it conforms to given performance requirements
</ul>

<p>
The class taught in the Spring 2016 semester should be considered a trial run
of the course. Hiccups are to be expected as the class finds new and exciting
ways to break course exercises and the instructor tries to fine-tune the
content and scope of each class period. 

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>CSE 422S (Operating Systems Organization) or graduate standing
  <li>Proficiency in C or C++, the entire Linux kernel is written in C and most assignments will require C (not C++)
  <li>Basic proficiency in using Linux will be greatly beneficial
  <li>A background with Linux software development is beneficial, but not required
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Studios">Discussions and Studios</a></h3>

This course is conducted in a studio format, both to emphasize the
hands-on nature of kernel hacking and to engage students in practical
learning exercises. The focus of lecture components is to facilitate in-class
discussion of the kernel design process, while the focus of studio exercises
is to gain experience kernel hacking, and to familiarize students with the 
tools and techniques of kernel development. Studios will be completed as
small group exercises, and are submitted for credit. All studios assigned
before the midterm are due the Friday prior to the midterm, and all
studios assigned after the midterm are due the Friday of the last day of
classes.

<p>
Most class periods are accompanied by suggested readings. 
The Linux kernel is amazing in that many of the
discussions and disagreements of the original developers
have been saved verbatim in repositories such as the the Linux Kernel Mailing
List (LKML) or documented by firsthand witnesses at sites such as lwn.net. 
It is the instructor's goal that the course
textbook can be used as a technical reference for kernel mechanisms, and
that supplemental readings can be used to understand the particular design
choices made in the course of kernel development.

<p>
A tentative course schedule is below. <b>Note that this schedule may change
over the course of the semester.</b> When changes occur, students will be 
notified in class and given enough advance notice so that readings and 
other preparation may be accommodated.

<h3><a name="Labs">Labs</a></h3>

<p>There will be two lab assignments for this course. The purpose of these labs is to apply course concepts and to evaluate competing design alternatives for kernel mechanisms. As such, each lab will require a written report detailing your findings in addition to a code submission. </p>

<p>Each lab will be completed in a team of two or three students, and teams may be different for each lab. Students from different teams may discuss the lab assignments <b>only during course meeting times</b>. Students from the same team are of course encouraged to discuss and work on lab assignments at any time. </p> 

<p>Labs submitted on time (as determined by email time stamp) will be given full credit. Labs submitted up to 24 hours late will be given a <b>ten percent penalty</b>. Labs submitted between 24 and 48 hours late will be given a <b>twenty percent penalty</b>. Labs submitted after 48 hours late will not be given credit, except in the case of extenuating circumstances pre-approved by the instructor.</p>

<p>The following labs have been so far assigned:</p>

<ul>
<li> None
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Course Project">Course Project</a></h3>

<p>The final project for this course is for a team of two or three students to propose and complete their own significant 
modification to the Linux kernel. This might be an entirely new capability or it might be an alteration
to an existing functionality. The students will evaluate the effectiveness of their modification through
the creation of user program test cases that successfully demonstrate the new behavior.
Students are encouraged to look to their own interests and/or
research projects for inspiration.</p> 

<p>In either case, students will justify their proposal in a written document,
in order to ensure that the scope of the project is achieveable. 
The proposal document will:

<ol> 
	<li>Propose a modification
	<li>Clearly explain the purpose of the modification
	<li>Identify kernel files that will require modification
	<li>Identify kernel data structures that will require modification
	<li>Identify kernel concepts and control paths that will require modification
	<li>Propose a set of user program test cases that demonstrate the modification
	<li>Include a five-week schedule for the project
</ol></p>

<p>The project will be evaluated via a 20 minute presentation at the end of the semester,
as well as a code submission to the instructor. This presentation should explain the
modification to the class; describe the final alterations to kernel files, data structures,
concepts that the students enacted; present timing graphs or other data to verify the
behavior of the modified system; and include a short demo (if possible).</p>

<h3><a name="Textbooks">Textbook and Class Resources</a></h3>

<p>Students should consider the in-class studios and assigned readings to be a guided tour
of the Linux kernel. Like any good tour group, we want to see the sights and learn some
neat highlights about who built it and what they were trying to accomplish. But, <b>the studios and
assigned readings will not make you an expert on the Linux kernel.</b> When it comes to learning
the details of a code base as deep and complex as this, <b>there is no substitute for reading
source code</b>. Lectures and studios will come with pointers to relevant source code files, and
it is expected that students will spend time absorbing the content there as well. Therefore,
assigned readings are kept moderately short with the expectation that you will spend some
independent time in the source code.</p>

<p>To be clear, you are not expected to understand or memorize every line of the Linux source.
Exams will not have questions derived from the Linux source (though basic kernel concepts
and pseudo-code are fair game). However, the kernel is a huge set of deeply interdependent
source code files. The only way you will ever understand it is by looking through it many times.</p>

<p>There is one required course textbook: <i>Linux Kernel Development</i> by Robert Love, 2010. 
This is an excellent, compact, and inexpensive text that gives the reader a basic
understanding of kernel design, written with the depth of a kernel veteran.</p> 

<p>There are a variety of decent references. 
None of these will give you the level of competency that comes
from looking at code itself, but they are very useful for starting points and clarifying problems.
However, the Linux kernel is rapidly updated, so while the general information in these books is
correct, details such as source code, names of files, and where files exist is likely to can
and does change.</p>

<ul>
	<p><li><i>
<a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/operating-systems-and-server-administration/linux/0596005652">Understanding the Linux Kernel</a></i> 
	by Bovet and Cesati, 2006. This is a more
	exhaustive reference to the kernel than the course textbook, covering many data structures
	and code snippets in detail. Available online for free through the university's subscription
	to the O'Riley Safari service.</p>
	<p><li><i><a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers</a></i>
	by Corbet, Rubini, and Kroah-Hartman, 2005. This book covers a topic that we will not
	go into in detail, but contains some useful reference material over kernel modules, kernel
	development, kernel locking, timing, and other topics. Available online for free through
	lwn.net.</p>
	<p><li><i><a href="http://lwn.net">LWN.net</a></i> is a news and information outlet
	for the open source community. They often run very high quality articles about kernel
	development, kernel architecture, and kernel mechanisms. When I have trouble finding
	a good online resource, a search for "lwn.net (my_topic)" often yields good results.
	However, beware of out-of-date material.</p>
	<p><li><i><a href="http://linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a></i> is a magazine covering
	the Linux community. They often run very high quality articles about kernel development,
	kernel architecture, and kernel mechanisms. Similar to above, searching for
	"Linux Journal (my_topic)" often yields good results. As above, beware of out-of-date
	material.</p>
	<p><li><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/?v=4.1">Linux Cross Reference
	by <i>free-electrons.com</i></a>. This tool easily allows you to browse the Linux source 
	code as well as search for identifiers. Beware that the source code on this site is not
	identical to the code base we are using in class, but it is still useful.</p>
</ul>

<p>Students will require a Raspberry Pi 2 in order to complete daily studios and lab assignments.
The course has been designed with the intention that students bring these devices to class, plug
them in, and do some hacking there. Monitors, keyboards, and mice will all be provided for this purpose-
you will need to provide the Raspberry Pi 2, a power cord, and an HDMI cable.</p>

<p>If you so desire, you may set up your Raspberry Pi 2 in your home or office and configure it
for remote access. However, the instructor cannot support you in this, and we are modifying
the kernel so you'll be lost in the dark if you reboot and can't ssh back into your machine.
Also, be forewarned that some exercises will require an X11 window, so simple ssh access will
not be enough to do everything remotely.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>

<p>There are four activities for which you will receive credit in this course: studios, labs, exams, and a course project. Studios are daily guided assignments primarily designed to familiarize students with course concepts, development tools, and the kernel source code (i.e. knowledge and comprehension tasks). Two lab assignments will ask students to apply general course concepts and analyze kernel design alternatives. The course project requires that students propose and complete a novel kernel modification. A midterm and final exam will evaluate your technical understanding of course concepts.</p>

<p>Your grade will be determined as follows:</P>
