<h2>Leaving your Pi at home</h2>

<ol>
<li><p class="hang"><b>How do I get terminal access while leaving my Pi at 
home?</b></p>

<ul>

<li><p>The first thing to know is your RPI2's username, IP address, and hostname. 
By default,
the username is <b>pi</b> and the hostname is <b>raspberrypi</b>. You can
look up your IP address with the command <code>ifconfig</code>. 

<li><p>The default Raspbian distribution for the RPI2 comes with an 
SSH server pre-enabled and running. 
If you are connecting to your RPI2 that is sitting on the same network
as you are, then depending on how your network is
configured, you should be able to just ssh to pi@(hostname), or failing that,
ssh to pi@(IP address).</p>

<li><p>If you have an office in the CSE department somewhere, the campus network
makes this easy. First, you will have to change your hostname (because there
are a lot of students with the default <b>raspberrypi</b>, and your device
will collide with theirs). Second, just plug your RPI2 into the network and
it will automatically recieve the address (hostname).seas.wustl.edu. To
connect, just ssh to pi@(hostname).seas.wustl.edu. (<b>NOTE:</b> You can only
connect to this address if you are inside the WashU firewall. To connect from
off-campus, you will first need to ssh inside one of WashU's internet-facing
servers, and then you can ssh to your RPI2 from there. For example, when I
connect from off campus, I first ssh into ssh.seas.wustl.edu, and then hop
over to (hostname).seas.wustl.edu.</p>

<li><p>If you would like to set up your RPI2 at home for remote access, you'll need
access to your internet router. The difficult thing about this is that your
RPI2 is given one IP address by your home router, while your home is given
a different IP address by your internet service provider. In order to make this work,
we need to configure your router so that ssh requests are <i>forwarded</i> to
your RPI2. By default, ssh communications are sent over port 22, so we need to
forward port 22 to your RPI2. Go into your router's advanced settings and
look for port forwarding (not port triggering, which is different). You will
need to add a custom rule that forwards port 22 to the internal IP address of
your RPI2. Then, use your router's configuration screen to look up what 
external IP address it has been assigned by your internet service provider.
In order to connect to your RPI2 while away from home, you should be able to
ssh to pi@(external IP address).</p>

<li><p>Note that if you are connecting to home, there is no guarantee that your
internet service provider will assign you the same IP address for long periods
of time. If this is the case, your external IP address may change frequently,
making the above approach difficult. There are two possible solutions.
First you can try calling your internet company and asking for a static IP
address. If they say no, or if you would prefer a more robust method, you can
see if your router supports a Dynamic DNS service. If so, there are 
many organizations that will give you a path (like david.noip.com) that
will always map to your home, no matter how often your external IP address
changes. There are organizations that will do this for free, and some router
manufacturers (like Netgear) offer this as a free service if you use one of
their routers.</p>

</ul>

<li><p class="hang"><b>How do I get a remote graphical interface while leaving
my Pi at home?</b><p>

<p>First, go through the steps for setting up a terminal interface at home
(above).</p>

<p>A free, open-source solution for getting remote graphical access to your Pi
is via VNC (Virtual Network Computing). You will need to install a VNC
server on your PI, and get a VNC client (viewer) in order to connect to your
server. An excellent open-source implementation of VNC is called
TightVNC, which provides both a server and a client.</p>

<p>The folks at raspberrypi.org have an excellent walk-through of how to 
install, configure, and automate the TightVNC server. This only takes a
few minutes to install and configure.
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md">You can access it here.</a>
Note that if you plan on sitting down and using your Pi through a regular keyboard
and monitor at home, in addition to connecting remotely, you probably don't want to
disable the existing display :0</p>

<p>Once you have that complete, you need to install the TightVNC viewer on
the machine that you'll use to connect to your Pi. The link above has
instructions if you're connecting from a Linux machine. If you're connecting
from Windows, go to tightvnc.com and download their viewer from there. If 
you're connecting from Mac OS, or from any machine that you can't install
software on, you can go to tightvnc.com and download their self-contained
Java viewer (which of course requires Java to be installed).</p>

<p>Finally, if you're connecting from outside of your house, you'll need to
forward ports 5900-5902 on your home router to your Pi. (See previous answer
for details.)</p>

<p>When connecting with a viewer, you will connect to 
(external IP address)::(port number). The port number is determined (by default)
to be 5900 plus the number of your display. So, if your VNC server is running
display :0, then your port number is 5900. If your VNC server is running
display :1, then your port number is 5901, etc.</p>
