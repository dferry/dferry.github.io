<h2 style="text-align: center;">SLUSH - the SLU Shell</h2>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Processes are the fundamental abstraction in any operating system- it can
be argued that the main purpose of an OS is to simplify execution of computer programs. 
A central part of this process is the program that allows a user to select and
execute other programs: on Unix-based OSes this is the <i>terminal</i> or <i>shell</i>.
The shell is not part of the operating system kernel, but it is a natural
extension of it and in many ways represents the operating system itself!</p>

<p>We never want to take programs like <code>bash</code> or <code>csh</code>
for granted, so we'll go through the dirty work of building or own shell
from scratch.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spawn new processes with the <code>fork()</code> and <code>execvp()</code>
system calls
<li>Wait for child processes with the <code>wait()</code> system call
<li>Perform complex input parsing in C 
<li>Pipe data between processes 
<li>Perform basic signal handling 
</ol>

<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p><code>slush</code> - SLU shell</p>

<p>
<code>slush</code> is a very simple command-line interpreter. It uses a different syntax than
shells like <code>bash</code>, and has much less functionality. <code>slush</code> executes in a loop in
which it displays a prompt, reads in a command line from standard input, and
executes the command.</p>

<p>
There are two types of commands: built in commands which are executed by
<code>slush</code> itself, and program execution commands which are carried out by separate
processes.</p>

<p>A built in command must appear on a line by itself. The only built in command
is:</p>

<p class="hang"><code>cd dir</code> - change current directory to <code>dir</code></p>

<p>Program execution commands have the form:<p>

<p class="hang"><code>prog_n [args] ( ... prog_3 [args] ( prog_2 [args] ( prog_1 [args]</code></p>

<p>This command runs the programs <code>prog_n</code>, ... , <code>prog_2</code>,
<code>prog_1</code> (each of which may 
have zero or more arguments) as separate processes in a "pipeline". This means
the standard output of each process is connected to the standard input of the
next.</p>

<p>The syntax of <code>slush</code> is backwards from shells you're used to, and is intended
to emphasize the functional nature of pipeline commands. As an example, the
command line:</p>

<p class="hang"><code>more ( sort ( ps aux </code></p>

<p>should produce a paginated, sorted list of processes.</p>

<p>
<code>slush</code> should catch ^C typed from the keyboard. If a command is running, this
should interrupt the command. If the user is entering a line of input, <code>slush</code>
should respond with a new prompt and a clean input line. </p>

<p><code>slush</code> will exit when it reads an end-of-file on input.</p>

<p><h3>Error Handling</h3></p>

<p>If a program name does not exist or is not executable, <code>slush</code> should print an
error message of the form:</p>

<p class="hang"><code>prog1: Not found</code></p>

<p>(To do this automatically, you can use <code>perror()</code> after the <code>exec()</code> fails).</p>

<p>Syntax errors such as:
<p class="hang"><code>more ( ( ps au</code></p>
<p class="hang"><code>more ( ps au (</code></p>

<p>should be handled with an appropriate message, such as:</p>

<p class="hang"><code>Invalid null command</code></p>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>
<p><ol>

<p><li>Work on parsing before you work on functionality. First write your
program so that it reads input and generates correct tokens.</p>

<p><li>Exiting on end-of-file (EOF) is VERY IMPORTANT because without it I cannot
test your program. This is the only way to exit <code>slush</code>. You can create a
EOF by typing ^D at the keyboard, or by running your program with noninteractive
input. For example, <code>echo ls | slush</code> should run <code>slush</code>, execute
the <code>ls</code> command, and quit <code>slush</code>. I suggest you read input using <code>fgets()</code>- the return value is false (0) on EOF.</p>

<p><li>To break the user input into tokens, you could use the
the <code>strtok()</code> function. For simplicity, you may restrict each command in a
pipeline to at most 15 arguments. You may also limit the length of an input line
to 256 characters. Violations of these limits may result in an error or simply be
ignored, so long as <code>slush</code> does not crash.</p>

<p><li>Turning the command into a pipeline of running processes is much easier if you
write a recursive function. Start at the left end of the command string, and
work right recursively. Processes should <code>fork()</code> off right to left as you return
from the series of recursive calls.</p>

<p><li>When a process has a pipe, it needs to <code>close()</code> the file descriptor for the end
of the pipe it's not going to use (or else it will never terminate). Do this after
each <code>fork()</code>. Both parent and child may need to close something.
Count your children... you'll need to <code>wait()</code> for them later.</p>

<p><li>Save the ^C handling for last. ^C generates a <code>SIGINT</code> signal. You need to set up
a signal handler to catch the signal. What happens if a signal is caught while
reading a line of input? How about if a signal is caught while <code>wait()</code> is waiting?
One more hint for ^C handling: typing ^| will send a <code>SIGQUIT</code> and stop your
process if you've screwed up ^C.</p>

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the name(s) of the people who
worked together on this lab.</p>

<p><li>Describe any known bugs or ways that your submission deviates from the
above specification.</p>

<p><li>Indicate which, if any, extra credit exercises you have attempted.</p>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>5% Extra Credit</b>: It's useful to know where you are in the
directory tree. Modify your <code>slush</code> prompt to print the current directory.
Don't print the entire directory path- just print everything past the user's
home directory. For example, if I login and issue the command
'<code>cd dir1/dir2</code>',
then the whole directory path is actually:</p>
<p class="hang"><code>/export/mathcs/home/faculty/dferry/dir1/dir2</code></p>
<p>That's much too long- I really just want to know the directory path within
my home directory. That is, I want my shell prompt to look something like:</p>
<p class="hang"><code>slush|dir1/dir2&gt;</code></p>
<p>The manual pages <code>getcwd(3)</code> and <code>getenv(3)</code> might
be helpful here, as well as the knowledge that there is an environment variable
called <code>HOME</code> that stores the current user's home directory.</p>

<p><h3>Submission</h3></p>

<!--
<p>Create a .tgz archive of your lab directory and email it to
<code><big><b>dferry_submit@slu.edu</b></big></code>.
-->

<p>Submit your program and related files via the Git repository.
Your submission must include a makefile
that will compile your program by simply issuing the command
<code>make</code>. You must also include a text file with your
answers to the required exercises. Please include your name and the names of
any partners in the body of your email.</p>
<!--
<p>The simple syntax for creating a .tgz archive is as follows:</p>

<p><code>tar -zvcf new_archive.tgz lab_directory</code></p>

<p>The syntax for unpacking a .tgz archive is:</p>

<p><code>tar -zvxf archive.tgz</code></p>

<p>Note that your archive <b>must not</b> include any binary executable files,
meaning any compiled programs or intermediate build objects (.o files, for
example). This will cause your email to be rejected by most services.</p>
