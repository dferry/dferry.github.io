<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Download <a href="pointers.c">this file</a> as a starting point
(remember that you can use the <code>wget</code> command to download a
file directly from a Linux terminal). 
Open up the file and look at <code>linString</code> and
<code>winString</code>. These variables demonstrate two different
ways that you can declare character strings in C. Convince yourself of this
by printing both strings with <code>printf()</code>. The correct format
specifier to print a string looks like this:</p>

<p><code>printf("%s\n", string_pointer);</code></p>

<p><li>Before we go any further, let's set up a <i>Makefile</i> in order to
make compiling your program easy. This is a special file that specifies how
to compile your project, so rather than having to invoke GCC every time you
want to re-build your program, you can simply use the command 
<code>make</code>.</p>

<p>Create a new file called "Makefile". Inside, on the first line, create a new
<i>target</i> by typing "<code>all:</code>". On the next line, first press TAB,
and then type your compilation instructions 
(<code>gcc -o pointers pointers.c</code>). Save and quit your file.

<p>Now type <code>make</code> at the Linux terminal. This command automatically
looks for a Makefile in the current directory, and if it can find one, it will
execute the instructions found under <code>all:</code>. The <code>make</code>
program will print out the commands it executes so you can verify if it is
working correctly. Makefiles can get much more complicated, but this simple
method is suitable for small software projects.</p>

<p>Leave the answer to this exercise blank, but attach your Makefile when you
submit this studio.</p>


<p><li>Now back to pointers.
In C, a string is simply a consecutive sequence of characters in memory with
an associated char pointer . (Notice that
the definition of our strings both use <code>char</code> as their base type.)
</p>

<p>We can access a string by <i>dereferencing</i> the string pointer. A pointer
points to data in memory, and dereferencing that pointer gives us the
<i>value</i> of the data. You've already done dereferencing through the use
of the square bracket <i>index notation</i>. The code
<code>linString[0]</code> gives you the first character of 
<code>linString</code>, the code <code>linString[1]</code> gives you the
second character, etc.</p>

<p>Print out each character of <code>linString</code> using a loop with
index notation. You can print a character as such: "<code>printf("%c\n", char_to_print)</code>.
Your output should look like:</p>
<pre>
L
i
n
u
x
!
</pre>

<p><li>The <i>dereference operator</i> in C is the asterisk (<code>*</code>) 
and is fundamental to using pointers. We
already know that a pointer stores the memory address of data (i.e. it points
to data). Just like indexing a pointer, the dereference operator obtains the 
<i>value</i> of the data that is pointed to.</p>

<p>If the pointer <code>winString</code> is a pointer to a
character, what character does it point to? In other words, what 
do you think is the value
of the dereference operation on <code>winString</code>?</p>

<p><li>Check your answer to the last exercise by dereferencing
<code>winString</code> and printing it out. The dereference operator is the
asterisk when placed to the left of a pointer. You can print out a single
character like so:</p>

<p><code>printf("%c\n", *pointer_to_string);</code></p>

<p>What was printed?</p>

<p><li>Another way to use pointers is with <i>pointer arithmetic</i>.
Suppose we have a regular string pointer called <i>ptr</i>,
as seen above this points to the first character of the string. To
access the next character we could add to this pointer as such:</p>

<p><code>ptr + 1  //same as saying ptr[1]</code></p>

<p>or we could access the fourth element of the string by adding:</p>

<p><code>ptr + 3  //accesses fourth element, same as ptr[3]</code></p>

<p>The index notation you just used is essentially pointer arithmetic 
(in fact the C standard defines index notation in terms of pointer
arithmetic).</p>

<p>What character is stored in the byte after the first character of
<code>winString</code>?
Try printing the value of the next few bytes of <code>winString</code> using
pointer arithmetic. To do so, add one, two, or three to the pointer before 
dereferencing. For example: <code>*(pointer_to_string + 1)</code>.</p>

<p><li>Use a loop to
print the entire contents of <code>winString</code> using pointer arithmetic,
one character at a time.
</p>

<p><li>Recall that a properly formatted C-style string is always
<i>null-terminated</i> (ends with the character '\0'). In fact,
all that the function <code>printf()</code> does when you ask it to
print a string is to start printing characters until encounters
that null-terminator.</p>

<p> Copy your solution to the previous exercise
and modify it to use the string format specifier (<code>"%s"</code>).
Make sure you don't dereference the pointer with an asterisk, but
you should do the same pointer arithmetic.
What do you think the output is going to be? Run your program and
compare your prediction with the output.</p>


<p><li>You can also use pointers to assign values rather than simply read
values. This is done by assigning a value to a dereferenced pointer (using
either index notation or pointer arithmetic). For example, the following two
statements turn the <code>'L'</code> in "<code>Linux</code>" into a 
<code>'M'</code>:</p>

<p><code>linString[0] = 'M';</code></p>
<p><code>*(linString) = 'M';</code></p>

<p>Write the code to change the string "<code>Linux!</code>" into the
string <code>"Minix!"</code>. Then, print <code>linString</code> again.
Copy and paste your program output as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>It's <i>very important</i> to note that the declarations of
<code>linString</code> and <code>winString</code> <b>are not functionally 
identical</b>. The declaration of <code>linstring</code> creates a
<i>static array</i> just large enough to hold the string "<code>Linux!</code>".
Static arrays are located in the program <code>.data</code> segment or on the
stack, depending on whether they are global or local declarations. The important
part is that somewhere the compiler allocates seven contiguous bytes to hold the
values <code>{'L', 'i', 'n', 'u', 'x', '!', '\0'}</code>, and that these values
exist in writeable memory..
</p>

<p>To contrast, where <code>linString</code> is a static array, 
<code>winString</code> is just a pointer. The compiler places the <i>string literal</i>
"<code>Windows!</code>" in read-only memory and then assigns the pointer
<code>winString</code> to point to there. Try modifying <code>winString</code>
like you did with <code>linString</code>. What happens?</p> 

<p><li>Lastly, one thing to keep in mind is how the <i>pointer type</i>
interacts with pointer arithmetic. First, let's figure out how big a given data
type is, in bytes, using the special <code>sizeof()</code> command in C. The
<code>sizeof()</code> command will return the number of bytes in a data type,
for example:</p>

<p><code>sizeof( char ) //returns 1</code></p>

<p>Write a short segment of code to print out the size of the <code>char</code>
data type and the <code>int</code> data type.</p>

<p><li>Pointer arithmetic is actually based on these data type sizes. If you
have a pointer to an integer then the associated size is four bytes. So the
statement <code>pointer[2]</code> is actually doing the computation:</p>

<p><code>pointer + 2*sizeof(int) = pointer + 2*4 bytes = pointer + 8 bytes</code></p>

<p>We can check this for ourselves directly. Declare a pointer to the
first and third elements of the <i>numbers</i> array, as such:</p>

<pre>
int *first = numbers;
int *third = &(numbers[2]);
</pre>

<p>Now, print out these two pointers with the <code>%p</code> format
specifier. What is the difference between them? Note that the values
are displayed in hexadecimal.</p>

<p><li>Lastly, explain the declaration of the pointer called <code>third</code>
above. What does the ampersand operator do?</p>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<p><li>As has been said a few times already, pointers simply point to 
data that resides in memory. Here's an experiment to convince you
of this, if you don't believe me already.</p>

<p>Open up your compiled executable file in a text editor. You will see a lot
of gibberish but you'll also see a few recognizable things. Use the search
function of your editor to search for the strings <code>"Linux!"</code> and
<code>"Windows!"</code>. Can you find them?</p>

<p>Now, being slightly careful, use your text editor to change 
<code>Windows!</code> to <code>Solaris!</code> and save the file. What happens
when you re-run the program?</p>

<p><i>Note: This is not the advisable way to modify a program!</i></p>
