<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 16<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Page Tables</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Page tables are used to implement paged memory systems by translating
between virtual addresses and physical addresses. These tables must be
managed by the operating system on a per-process basis, as all processes
contain some number of pages that may be loaded into available page
frames (physical memory).</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compute page table properties
<li>Translate between virtual addresses and physical addresses
</ol>

Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p>

As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Suppose you're working on a system with 1GB (2^30 = 1,073,741,824 bytes) of RAM 
and a page size of 4Kb (2^12 = 4,096 bytes). How many page frames are available
to the system?</p>

<p><li>Suppose that same system uses 32-bit virtual addresses, so each process can
access up to 2^32 bytes of memory. How many pages of 
memory could each process potentially use? </p>

<p><li>The answer to the last exercise should be larger than the answer to the first
exercise. What happens if a process (or collection of processes) generate more
pages than there are available page frames in memory? Does the system crash?</p>

<p><li>On that same system, what is the theoretical maximum number of entries for the page table
of a single process? (Hint- it's the answer to one of the first two exercises.)</p>

<p><li>What is the maximum size of that page table, assuming that each entry is 32 bits?</p>

<p><li>In the same system, given the number of possible pages in a process, how many bits of a 32-bit
virtual address are required to specify the page number? 

<p><li>In the same system, which bits of a 32 bit virtual address are used to specify the 
page number? Which bits are the offset?</p>

<p><li>In the same system, how many bits will a physical address contain after
translation? (Hint- consider the size of the physical memory)

<p><li>Considering how many page frames are in this system, how many bits of
a physical address are needed to indicate the page frame?</p>

<p><li>Which bits of the physicial address indicate the page frame? Which bits
indicate the offset?</p>

<p><b>For the remaining questions, consider the following page table which
does not reflect the previous exercises. Suppose a page size of 1024 bytes:
</b></p>

<table border="2">
	<tr>
		<th>Page<br>(in binary)</th>
		<th>Page Frame<br>(in binary)</th>
		<th>Valid</th>
		<th>Modified</th>
		<th>Permissions</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0000</td>
		<td>10011</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>r</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0001</td>
		<td>10100</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rw</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0010</td>
		<td>00101</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>rx</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0011</td>
		<td>10111</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rw</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0100</td>
		<td>00000</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>rw</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0101</td>
		<td>00110</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>rx</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p><li>Which page(s) do you think contain read-only program data?</p>
<p><li>Which page(s) do you think contain executable program code?</p>
<p><li>There are 2^10 bytes in each page. How many bits are in each virtual
and physical address?</p>
<p><li>What physical address does the virtual address <code>00110001111000</code> translate to?</p>
<p><li>What virtual address does the physical address <code>001101110000111</code> correspond to?</p>
