<h2 style="text-align: center;">Atomic Instructions</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>It is common to use mutexes, semaphores, or other generic locking methods
to synchronize access to variables in general purpose parallel programming.
However, when the data to be modified
is small, it may be possible to use an <i>atomic instruction</i>. These are
machine operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR,
etc. that are guaranteed to happen atomically via special support between
the compiler and the computer hardware. Note that such atomic instructions are
not part of the C standard, but rather a special extension provided by GCC.
This studio must be done on GCC. However, standard support for atomic
operations has been added in C++ 11 under <code>std::atomic</code>.</p>


<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use atomic intstructions to synchronize access to a variable
<li>Measure the overhead of using these atomic instructions
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>The atomic instructions we are going to use today are not part of the
C standard, so they are not documented as well as other language features that
we have used. Go to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.3/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html">
GCC reference page</a> to look see these functions and their usage. As the
answer to this question, describe the effect of the function 
<code>__sync_add_and_fetch()</code> and this function's interface.</p>

<p><li>Create a new program to test the behavior of your atomic instructions.
To do so, declare a variable with initial value zero, and then use the
instruction <code>__sync_add_and_fetch()</code> to add to it. Print out the
value of your variable before and after your atomic instruction to verify
that your program behaves as expected. Copy and paste your program output,
and attach this file to your submission.</p>

<p><li>Now, make a copy of your code from the previous studio where we
created a race condition. Previously we fixed this race condition by
using a Pthreads mutex. Today we will fix the race condition with these
atomic instructions.</p>

<p>Use the functions <code>__sync_add_and_fetch()</code> and
<code>__sync_sub_and_fetch()</code> to make your adder and subtractor
functions thread-safe. Run your program to verify that there is no race
condition. Copy and paste your program output.</p>


<p><li>Now we want to quantify the overhead of using these atomic
instructions. The special hardware support needed is not free, and we pay
a price for each atomic instruction you use. As in the previous studio,
modify your atomic instruction program (if necessary) so that it performs
twenty million (20,000,000) atomic increments and decrements. Then time
your program with the <code>time</code> command. Take at least three
measurements and average them. Copy and paste your program results.</p>

<p><li>One question we can ask is whether the atomic instruction is
more efficient than the mutex for this task, or is it the other way
around? Go to your previous studio writeup and find how long it took your
mutex program to run when you locked and unlocked the mutex for each
individual increment and decrement. Alternately, you can re-run this
experiment- if you do so, make sure you are performing twenty million
increments and decrements, and make sure that you are locking and
unlocking the mutex for each individual increment and decrement.</p>

<p><li>Is the mutex locking strategy faster, or are the atomic instructions
faster? By how much? Express the speed difference as a ratio (for
example, you could say procedure A is four times faster than procedure B).</p>

<p><li>Go back to your last studio writeup where you
timed how long your racy program takes (the one with incorrect results) and
record this value here. Alternately, you can re-run the experiment- make sure
you are doing twenty million increments and decrements.</p>

<p>Compared to the racy program, how much longer does it take to run the
program with atomic instructions?</p>

<p><li>Given what you now know about atomic instructions and mutex locking,
give one scenario where mutex locking is preferred, and give one scenario
where atomic instructions are preferred.</p>
