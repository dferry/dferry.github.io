human input from previous conversations to come up with their responses.
As such, their statements may contain objectionable or offensive content.
Feel free to skip these bots or to stop using them if you are at all
uncomfortable.</b>

<P>
As we begin to think more seriously about the Turing Test and what
it could mean, we should have some real interactions with chat bots.
Each of the exercises below will ask you to interact with a chat bot
or other program that generates text.</P>

<P>
Recall that in class you had a five-minute conversation with another student
in order to form a baseline expectation of what a "cold conversation" might be
like. Take a moment to mentally review that experience before starting.
There, you knew that your partner was a real human being. Here,
you know that your "partners" are computers. How do the interactions compare?
</P>

<p>Since you know these are machines, you might be tempted to "dissect" the chat bots
with unusual or leading prompts. That's fine, but I would also encourage you to
imagine yourself having an earnest "cold converation" with the bot as well. Pretend
you don't know the thing on the other end is a computer.
</p>

	<h3>Exercise 1: ELIZA</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Spend five minutes interacting with ELIZA at the following site:</li>
	<li><a href="https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html">https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html</a></li>
	<li>ELIZA is one of the first chat bots ever constructed. Its chat pattern is
	modeled after the way a therapist might try to get a patient to
	open up and discuss a difficult topic- the bot listens for key words
	and then uses leading language to ask you to keep going. The hope is that you
	can "self-therapize" simply by working to put your own thoughts into words.</li>
	<li>ELIZA works best when you talk about yourself. For example, try starting
	a conversation with, "This is my first semester at college and things haven't
	gone perfectly."</li>
</ul>
	<h3>Exercise 2: ALICE</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Spend five minutes interacting with ALICE at the following site:</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b8d616e35e36e881">https://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b8d616e35e36e881</a></li>
	<li>ALICE works similarly to ELIZA in that it has a pretty mechanistic approach
	to conversation based in "pattern matching." However, at the time it was
	state-of-the-art, winning the Loebner Prize three times in 2000, 2001, and 2004.</li>
</ul>
	<h3>Exercise 3: Cleverbot</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Spend five minutes interacting with Cleverbot at the following site:</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.cleverbot.com/">https://www.cleverbot.com/</a></li>
	<li>Cleverbot is significantly unlike the first two bots. I won't describe
	how it works here, but it has a much larger range of discourse than the
	other bots.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Exercise 4: Blenderbot 3</h3>
<ul>
        <li>Spend five minutes interacting with Blenderbot at the following site:</li>
        <li><a href="https://blenderbot.ai/chat">https://blenderbot.ai/chat</a></li>
	<li>Blenderbot 3 is developed by Facebook/Meta and launched just this year as
	a public research project. It tries to imitate a character that it creates
	on the fly as you talk with it, essentially trying to give the bot its own
	consistent identity.</li>
	<li>After a few minutes conversation, press the "Look Inside" button at the
	top of the page to see what the bot has learned about you as well as what
	elements of its persona it has developed. You can also reset the bot here,
	causing it to forget everything and start over.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise 5: Reflection</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Take a few minutes to write down your impressions of each bot- what
	topics did you discuss? What worked well? What didn't work well? What
	surprised you? We will discuss our observations in class and will use
	them in the future as well.</li>
</ul>
