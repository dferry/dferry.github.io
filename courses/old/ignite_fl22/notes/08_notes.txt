Perspective - AI Generated Art

Class plan: 
  - Demonstrate inpainting technique
  - Demonstrate outpainting technique or use the blog video
  - Discussion questions on art
  - Lecture on how DALL-E system works at high level
  - Lecture on computability/mechanizability if we have time

Guiding questions:
1. What is art?
2. What makes art, art?
3. Is AI generated art a form of artistic endeavor?

Comments:
1. Yes, we might put some painters and sketch artists out of work.
   - Is the physical act of creating the art with pen and paper the central 
     part of art?
2. Book imagery from last time: "maggot therapy"
   - What does DALL-E tell us is an essential part of art, and not part of art?
   - Do you buy that?
3. Accessibility
   - People who don't have manual art skills- drawing, painting, etc. are able
     to participate.
   - People who are actually disabled are able to participate.

Discussion questions:
1. On a scale of 1 to 10, is generating images with DALL-E an artistic
   endeavor?
2. In chapter 4 the author uses the image "maggot therapy" where AI eats away
   everything that is not really a human endeavor.
   - Does this change your opinion of art?
   - Does this change your opinion of the "maggot therapy" concept?
   - Is it true that pure ability is what should differentiate human from not
     human activity?
3. Should those who have "art skills" (sketching, painting, etc.) act as
   gatekeepers for others who want to create art?
   - Social good of extending art to everyone
   - Democratization of art- e.g. consider the printing press and access
     to books
4. What are the limitations of DALL-E vs. a human artist?
   - One dimensional art
   - Every image is totally separate from others, need to be spaitally joined
     to have a consistent style. Imagine illustrating every page of a single
     comic book with each page having a varying style.


Lecture:
* How DALL-E works
  - Text model combined with an image model, then put through "diffusion" process
  - Input: images and captions
  - DALL-E learns a "latent space" where each language feature is a dimension
    and associates each image in the training data with a point in that latent
    space
  - Imagine you have a 2D plot, and X axis is labeled Dog and the Y axis
    is labeled Cat. At (1,0) you have a cluster of dog images, and at (0,1) you
    have a cluster of cat images, and at (1,1) you have a cluster of images
    that have both a cat and a dog. 
  - Then, you enter a new text string, that translates to a point of (0.7, 0.3)
  - The diffusion process attempts to generate an image that blends all of the
    input data that it had around that point

Lecture:
* What things are mechanizable?
  - Analogous question - What is computable?
  - Alan Turing: Founder of Computability Theory, 1938
    - A set of numbers is **computable** if, for any number N, a machine can
      determine whether the number is in the set and halt (stop computation)
    - Example- set of even numbers, set of odd numbers, prime numbers,
              multiples of 5, fibonacci numbers most other sets you can think of
    - Hard example - (X, Y, S) such that a machine executing program X
      given input Y halts within S steps
    - One needs to give an **algorithm** that works for any number and is
      guaranteed to halt in order for the set to be computable
    - Turing formalized the notion of a machine and an algorithm, which allowed
      him to prove statements about whether or not a program could or could not
      exist that computed certain statements.

  - Even numbers: Given N, start with 2, keep adding 2. If N ever shows up, then
    we accept. If our number is greater than N, then we reject.
    - Odds, fibonacci numbers, multiples of 7, etc. are all the same

  - Examples of **undecidable** problems:
    - a type of computational problem that requires a yes/no answer, but where 
      there cannot possibly be any computer program that always gives the 
      correct answer; that is, any possible program would sometimes give the
      wrong answer or run forever without giving any answer.
    - Classic example: Halting Problem
    - Proving Mathematical Theorems
    - Air travel planning (this is not path finding- it is finding whether
      a valid air route exists between
      destinations A and B under a given fare structure- the fare structure
      used by the airlines is what makes this hard, not the pathing)
