The Migratory Soul Chapter 3 Discussion

Recall: Chapter 2 -> What things make us seem human? -> Consistent identity!

This chapter: What things actually make us human?

1. Hard question, lots of possible definitions

2. When does a person actually become a person?
  - Everyone recognizes there was a time before they were a person (e.g. pre-birth)
  - At some point they became a person
  - Sometimes we want a legal, precise definition (e.g. suppose we're writing a law)
  - We can also consider other methods of approaching this truth 
    * Recall the Myth of Narcissus definition of narcissism

3. Migratory Soul -> Our perception of humanness has changed over time
  - Soul in this case being our "essential human essence" which might be a tangible soul
      to some peoples and cultures over time, but does not have to be. E.g. the Greek
      concept of the truest expression of what it means to be human.

  - Some ideas from the chapter:
    * Physical location of the "human center" has changed from breast to head

    * Everything has a specific function, and we are most human when we fulfill that
        function. Called eudaimonia, U-DAI-MON-E-AH. Not related to hapiness.
        The translation the author likes is "flourishing," though this does not fully capture it.
        E.g. a knife's eudaimonia is to cut things

    * I think, therefore I am. Logic and thinking are what makes us uniquely human.
      - How do we differentiate ourselves from computers, in this case?

    * Stoics v. Epicureans
      - Stoics: we are most human when impassionate, rational, and driven by reason, i.e. brain first
      - Epicureans: we are most human when we immerse ourselves in the sensory experience
                    of being human, i.e. body first

    * Reason vs. Emotion
      - Left hemisphere vs Right hemisphere
        * Left -> language center, "the interpreter"
        * Right -> Spatial and reasoning
      - Patients who have their corpus callosum severed have trouble making decisions
        * People are not entirely economically rational, e.g. 1 million vs 4 million question
        * Some questions are not rational at all, e.g. pick a pen or a wallet becomes difficult
            for those who lack the ability to make emotional decisions

    * Death vs. Life
      - Death shows us what life is not
      - Death is overwhelmingly defined in scientific, medical terms
        * Is life and humanity the anti-death?      

    * Body and Brain antagonism
      - Is our body an essential part of being human? If so, why?
      - Does our sensory experience and interpretive experience matter?
      - Is our brain, logic, and cognition an essential part of being human? If so, why?
      - What makes our cognition special, if not the application of logic? If it is logic,
        what about computers then?
      - "We start by educating the whole body, then just the top half, then the head, then just one side."
        * Why don't we insist that people take dance and theater for 12 years in public education?

    * Computer tacked onto creature
      - Collaboration is the point, the goal is not to be antagonistic to one or the other

4. What to do with it?
  - Uniqueness per se might not have anything to do with it
  - Ramparts we built to keep other animals, other species out of "human" might have also kept us in
  - Computer is one way of seeing what is easy vs. hard
  - Computer is one way of differentiating humans and animals
    * If our only point of comparison is animals, we identify human as anti-animal
    * A third point of comparison, that does some things in both the human and animal realm, is a good
        point of comparison
  - Computer's first achievements in the realm of logic and reason, the "highest" human activity,
      before it could ride a bike or interpret language like a 4 year old
  - Computer can translate before paraphrase
  - Can draft postmodern theory essays before being shown a picture of a chair and recognizing "chair"


Do Now questions when you sit down -  
* What does the author mean by Soul in the "Migratory Soul"?
* Body and Brain - If you had to pick just one, which do you more closely associate
                   with our universal shared human experience? Why?
* Are humans rational or emotional: 1 million guaranteed vs 4 million with a 50% chance
* When does a human become a human?
  - Newborn babies eat and poop and sleep, i.e. dominated by the "messy" human processes
* Draw a triangle with humans, animals, and computers in each corner, what activities and things
    belong in which corners? What is unique to the three? 


Class Activity - Defining Humanness
  - Many avenues to capture/define what it means to be human
    * Science
    * Philosophy
    * Religion
    * Medical / alive / death
    * Poetry 
    * Stories 
    * Paintings
    * Music
    * Dance
    * Other creative expression
  - Working with a group, find an artifact you're willing to share with the group and explain
    why it exemplifies, or tells the story of, or captures, or defines what it means to be human
  - Keep a list of your personal "top contenders," that speak to you, you do not have to pick just one
  - WHOLE POINT:
    - Identify WHAT your themes of humanity are, WHAT matters to YOU?
    - Find something that you would sacrifice for, give up a lot of your life for, would change your life for
    - You will be paired with people with similar themes of humanity next time



To have passion, to commit to passion
To experience intense community, to rely on someone and trust someone completely

    * Philosophy
    * Religion
      - Ecclesiastes 3
	"There is a time for everything,
	 and a season for every activity under heaven:
	 time to be born and a time to die,
	 time to plant and a time to uproot,
	 time to kill and a time to heal,
	 time to tear down and a time to build,
	 time to weep and a time to laugh,
	 time to mourn and a time to dance,
	 time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
	 time to embrace and a time to refrain,
	 time to search and a time to give up,
	 time to keep and a time to throw away,
	 time to tear and a time to mend,
	 time to be silent and a time to speak,
	 a time to love and a time to hate,
	 a time for war and a time for peace."

         For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
         Shall be my brother."
