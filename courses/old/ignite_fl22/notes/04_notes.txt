Perspectives: Meet the Bots

Students were asked to interact with four different bots from different times:
ELIZA		1966
ALICE		1995
Cleverbot	1997
BlenderBot 3	2022


1. Ask students to discuss with themselves in group:
	- Pick one of ELIZA/ALICE and one of Cleverbot/Blenderbot
	- For both, discuss:
	- What lines of conversation worked well?
	- What lines of conversation did not work well?
	- What surprised you?
	- After 7-8 minutes, a group rep reports.

2. Introduce concept of Algorithms
	-Algebra, al-Jabir, the word meant to move a term from one side of an equation to the other
	-Written by a Persian mathematician (latinization and corruption) into al-Goritmi
		-Early arithmetic procedures became known as algorithms

	-For example, written algorithm for adding two numbers:
	1. Write the larger number on top
	2. Write the smaller number on bottom
	3. Look at the rightmost column
	A:
	4. Sum the column
	5. Write the ones-digit result below the line
	6. If greater than 10, write a 1 over the next column
	7. If anything is to the left of the current column, move one step left and go back to A
	8. Done

	- Can also write this as a flow chart

	- Algorithms have become commonplace:
		- Nursing: ADPIE - Assess, Diagnose, Plan, Implement, Evaluate
		- Jesuit: Context - Experience - Reflection - Action - Eval
		- Many other contexts as well...

3. Come up with a multiply or divide algorithm in a group?
	-NOT allowed to use the word "multiply" or "divide"

4. Come up with your own chatbot algorithm in a group
	- With 10 minutes left, share with group
