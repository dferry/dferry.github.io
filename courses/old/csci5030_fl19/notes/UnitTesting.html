<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 5030: Unit Testing<br></h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Unit testing is a central part of modern software testing and Test-Driven
Development (TDD). Every language has some kind of unit testing support. Some
are separate libraries or frameworks (such as JUnit or Pytest), while others
are integrated into the language or in an IDE (such as with Microsoft
Visual Studio). Many of the concepts and IDEs are similar, though different
language capabilities (objects, exceptions, etc.) result in different
unit testing capabilities.</p>

<p><b>This exercise is written in Python using <code>pytest</code>, but
you are free to use any language or test suite you prefer.</b> These
exercises as written should be doable on hopper.slu.edu without any effort
on your part.</p>

<p>In this exercise you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explore basic unit testing using logical assertions
  <li>Learn the difference between dummies, stubs, mocks, spies,and fakes
  <li>Write a short piece of software using Test-Driven Development
</ol>

<p><h3>Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>

<p><li>Before we start you should create a new directory and move into it.
<code>pytest</code> by default will recursively search directories visible from
the current directory when it looks for tests. Running the following
exercises from your default home directory may take a long time or could
result in unwanted behavior.</p>

<p><li>First, we will explore the basic unit testing interface provided by
<code>pytest</code>. Imagine you are writing a software library, meaning you
are authoring a collection of functions, but you are not trying to write a
finished executable. If you're like me, traditionally you test your software
by running it in a traditional executable and printing lots of input/output 
pairs. This works, but unit testing with <code>pytest</code> is a better
solution: pytest lets you run tests independent of any particular finished
program, and it assesses correctness for you. Moreover, a good set of unit
tests then become a <b>regression test suite</b>- if you ever refactor your code
you can re-run your unit tests and verify that the overall behavior has not
changed.</p>

<p>Start by creating a file called <code>myLibrary.py</code> and writing a
trivial function inside. For example, the contents of your file might be:

<pre>
def myFunction(x):
	return x + 1;
</pre>

<p><b>Remember:</b> Correct indentation in Python is non-optional. The 
function definition should start at the beginning of a line and the return
statement should have a tab in front of it.</p>




<p><li>Second, let's test that your function runs the way you expect. You can
invoke your code directly from the python interpreter. To do so, run the
python interpreter with the "python" command from the terminal. Then, you will
need to import your code with "<code>import myLibrary</code>" and finally you
can run it with (for example) "<code>myLibrary.myFunction(5)</code>". In total,
your output might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
[username@hopper directory]$python

Python 2.7.5 (default, Aug  7 2019, 00:51:29) 
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import myLibrary

>>> myLibrary.myFunction(5)
6

>>> 
</pre>

<p>Make sure your code runs as expected. You will have to press CTRL-D to quit
the Python interpreter.</p>




<p><li>Now let's use <code>pytest</code> to create a test suite for this
function. There are several ways you can specify tests to be run, but for
now we will separate all our tests into another file. However, be warned
that there are some considerations when constructing test suites for
large or complicated projects. <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#test-discovery">
See the following documentation on <code>pytest</code> test discovery
for full details.</a></p>

<p>Create a file called <code>test_example.py</code>. The "<code>test_</code>"
tells <code>pytest</code> that this file contains a unit test. Then, we can
create a unit test by defining a function within that file that also has the
"<code>test_</code>" preface. For example, we can create a unit test assertion
with the following:</p>

<pre>
import myLibrary

def test_case1():
        assert myLibrary.myFunction(2) == 3
</pre>

<p>Then, since both the file and the test within the file should be
automatically discoverable by <code>pytest</code>, we can run the unit test
just by typing "<code>pytest</code>" at the termina. Do so now, and the test
should run successfully.</p>



<p><li>Of course, the goal of unit testing is to catch failing tests. Let's
create a test that is designed to fail. Add the following to your
<code>test_example.py</code>:</p>

<pre>
def test_case2():
        assert myLibrary.myFunction(5) == 7
</pre>

<p>Since both test cases are prefaced with "<code>test_</code>" we can execute
the entire test suite just by typing "<code>pytest</code>" at the terminal.</p>

<pre>

</pre>



<p><li>Our test failed, as expected. Note that <code>pytest</code> is trying to
be as helpful as possible. The failure message indicates the test case that
failed as well as the values in the assertion, and even gives us a stack trace
of where the value "6" came from above.</p>

<p>Go ahead and fix the failing test, and confirm that you can run
<code>pytest</code> without errors.</p>




<p><li>Of course, the file <code>myLibrary.py</code> can have more than one
function and the file <code>test_example.py</code> can have more unit tests.
Write a few functions and try out various logical assertions ( ==, !=, &lt;, 
&gt;, etc).</p>



<p><li>Now we will introduce a series of test objects called "test doubles."
These are made just for the purpose of testing, and their purpose is to stand
in for other software components. Sometimes software units are interdependent
on each other and there's no getting away from it, but in general, you want to
minimize your test's dependence on other pieces of software.</p>

<p>Why? First, that other software may not be written yet, especially if you 
are doing TDD. Second, there's no guarantee that other software is correct.
Suppose that software A depends on software B to function, and software A's
tests are failing. Where does the error come from? At first glance it's not
obvious if the error stems from A, or from B, or from the interface between
them. However, if the software B is actually a fake test double, then you
can rule it out as a source of error. Moreover, you can do system integration
tests later whose sole purpose is to test A with B, so it's just fine if the
unit tests for A don't really test A with B.</p>

<p>The test doubles we will look at are called dummies, stubs, spies, mocks,
and fakes. The first four are related to each other, and each builds upon 
the others (in the order given above). Using the simplest possible test
double makes your tests easier to write, and makes it obvious
exactly what is and is not tested.<p>

<p>We saw <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/14/TheLittleMocker.html">
this article</a> about these test doubles earlier that describes
each of these in a simple, conversational style. Go ahead and read it,
if you have not already.</p>

<p><li>To discuss test doubles we will write a series of unit tests for
<code>car.py</code>, a simple class for representing your everyday automobile.
You can download <code>car.py</code> to the current directory of your Linux
terminal with the following command:</p>

<p><code>wget https://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/csci5030/notes/car.py</code></p>

<p>Or, you can access it directly 
<a href="https://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/csci5030/notes/car.py">with this
link</a>. Do so, and take a moment to read over the code. Hopefully nothing
there should be terribly surprising.</p>

<p><li>Now, let's write our first unit test. In particular, let's assert
that a newly constructed car object should always have its distance counter
set to zero. To do so we can use a line like:</p>

<p><code>assert myCarInstance.distance == 0</code></p>

<p>Easy to say, but we can't actually run this test yet. Why? First we need
to call the constructor for the car class, and the constructor expects an
<code>engine</code> object and a <code>fuel_tank</code> object. We don't have
those objects yet... so what are we to do? We could give up on testing
<code>car</code> until we actually have implementations for <code>engine</code>
and <code>fuel_tank</code>, but that's a bad solution. This is exactly the
situation for a test double, and in particular we need a <b>dummy</b> double.</p>

<p>A dummy double is used whenever we need to pass an argument, but we know
that the argument is never actually used. That's the case here. If you look
at the code for <code>car.py</code> you can see that the <code>distance</code>
attribute is set in the constructor, and <code>engine</code> and
<code>fuel_tank</code> objects are not actually used.</p>

<p>Try to write a unit test using dummy objects. If you get stumped, or when
you're done, you can see <a href="test_car1.py">my solution</a>.</p>




<p><li>Two remarks about my solution to the previous problem. First,
the structure of the empty class doesn't really matter. The dummy is not used
by definition. We don't even need a constructor, since our dummy objects will
automatically inherit the default constructor.</p>

<p>However, the second point is that we don't actually even need dummy classes
to begin with, but only because we're using Python. Python is a very flexible 
language, and in particular there are no strong data types. The result is that
Python doesn't really care what we pass to the <code>car</code> constructor...
we can pass anything we want and Python will just throw us an error if we try
to use it incorrectly. However, since <code>engine</code> and
<code>fuel_tank</code> are never used, they can't be used incorrectly either.
I would still suggest the first solution because it's only a few extra
keystrokes and it makes it obvious what you're doing, but you could have
gotten away with a solution <a href="test_car2.py">that looks like this</a></p>

<p>In a more strongly typed language, such as Java, you'd always have to create
a proper dummy object.</p>

<p><li>Now, let's think about testing the <code>computeRange()</code> function.
Now mere dummy objects are no longer enough because we need to access the
<code>fuel_tank.size</code> and <code>engine.MPG</code> attributes. However,
the actual values returned can be chosen by you, the tester. This is the
purpose of a <b>stub</b> test double.</p>

<p>Create a stub test double for the <code>engine</code> and
</code>fuel_tank</code> classes by giving them the appropriate attributes.
Then, write a unit test or two for the <code>computeRange()</code> function.
<a href="test_car3.py">My solution is here when you're done.</a></p>

<p>In particular, note that an empty class is no longer acceptable for testing
this new function. If you try to use the dummy classes from before you'll get
errors about accessing the <code>size</code> and <code>MPG</code> attributes.
</p>

<p><li>Third, now we would like to create a <b>spy</b> test double. Unlike the
previous two, the purpose of the spy is to inspect the state of the system.
Now- why is this useful? Consider the <code>fillGasTank()</code> function.
This is a difficult function to test, because all that happens is that we 
call a method in the <code>fuel_tank</code> class. From the point of view
of the person testing <code>car.py</code>, the <code>fillGasTank()</code>
function is essentially a black box. All we really can do is verify that
<code>fuel_tank.refill()</code> is called. Hence, we use a spy
test double to verify exactly that.</p>

<p>Now, we could implement our own spy similar to what is shown in <i>The
Little Mocker</i>, but Python includes support for creating spies and other
mock objects in the <code>unittest</code> module. This module is an alternative
to <code>pytest</code> in many respects, and while <code>pytest</code> is perhaps more
intuitive than <code>unittest</code>, the <code>unittest</code> module includes
some indispensible functionality that is not provided by <code>pytest</code>.
One of these features is the ability to create and use mock objects.</p>

<p>In particular, you can import the <code>unittest.mock</code> module, and
take a brief look <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">
at the documentation here</a>. The basic workflow is to create an instance
of the class you want, and then create mock methods using the 
<code>unittest.mock</code> module. Then, the module automatically logs if and
how the mocked methods are called, and allows you to use a set of assert 
statements to confirm the behavior.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="test_car4.py">my implementation of a spy object here
</a>. If you run this test case as-is, you should get an assertion error
at line 19 because the call to <code>fillGasTank()</code> is commented
out. Once you uncomment that line the test case should run successfully.</p>

<p><li>Another method to spy on is the call to <code>fuel_tank.subtract()</code>
in the <code>drive()</code> function. One feature of the 
<code>unittest.mock</code> module is that you can spy on what specific values
a function is called with. Use the documentation above to write a set of
stubs and spies that verifies the value passed to
<code>fuel_tank.subtract()</code>. In particular, if <code>miles = 60</code>
and <code>engine.MPG = 30</code>, then the value passed to 
<code>fuel_tank.subtract()</code> should be <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure that your code passes correctly, and then fails if you change some
of the numbers involved. <a href="test_car5.py">My solution is here</a>.</p>

<p><li>Surprise! The previous exercise had you create a <b>true mock object</b>.
The spy we created first merely verified that the function
<code>fuel_tank.refill()</code> was called. That spy looked at actions happening
in the system, but it was oblivious to the actual behavior of the system. This
last exercise created a mock object that expects a certain behavior... given a
certain initial state (attribute values) and an input (<code>drive(60)</code>)
the mock object knew that <code>fuel_tank.subtract()</code> should be called
with value <code>2</code>.</p>

<p><li>The last test double we will look at today are <b>fakes</b>. These are
so-called because they imitate the system under test, but they're not the
system. Another name for a fake might be a simulation. A fake simulates elements
of the system under test, with the goal that whatever simulation is provided is
accurate enough to be informative without requiring prohibitive development
time itself.</p>

<p>The last method in <code>car.py</code> computes the total weight of the
vehicle dependent on how much gas is in the fuel tank. Suppose we want to
validate that driving our vehicle does in fact consume gas, and that it
should weigh less after calling the <code>drive()</code> function than it did
before. To do so we need some kind of logic implementing the
<code>computeWeight()</code> function. We don't necessarily need the full or
completely accurate implementation of the <code>fuel_tank</code> class, we just
need something approximate. We need a fake. 

<p>Write a fake <code>fuel_tank</code> that includes an implementation of
the <code>subtract()</code> and <code>computeWeight()</code> functions. Then,
verify that the weight after driving is less than the weight that was before
driving. You can see <a href="test_car6.py">my solution here</a>. If you modify
the <code>drive(60)</code> line to drive a negative number of miles then you
can induce a test failure to prove to yourself that the test works. (And 
that we can magically grow gasoline just by driving in
reverse. I guess we should have had a unit test for that, huh?)</p>

<p><li>Now, armed with your knowledge of unit testing in Python, I'd like you
to engage in test-driven development (TDD). As we said in class, in TDD you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write down a list of features
<li>Pick one feature
<li>Write down a set of tests that verify/accept that feature
<li>Write a set of test cases, and just enough code for your program to run
<li>Run the test cases and verify that they fail
<li>Then, write just enough code to make all tests pass
<li>Go back to part 2, unless we have no more features
</ol>

<p><li>Create a file called <code>shapes.py</code>. Then, create a class called
<code>rectangle</code>. The constructor should take two arguments: the length
and the width of the rectangle. You should implement functions called
<code>computeArea()</code> and <code>computePerimeter()</code>. Develop this
code using TDD. Remember that writing good test cases in TDD is tantamount to
requirements analysis in traditional software development. Make sure to consider
edge cases such as what happens if a user passes negative numbers for length
or width, (or both), or if they pass non-numeric data such as <code>None</code>
or a string. What happens if the user passes zeros to your constructor- does
the code behave how you'd like, or were you surprised?</p>

<p><li>If you would like, repeat the above exercise for triangles, circles,
cylinders, etc.</p>
