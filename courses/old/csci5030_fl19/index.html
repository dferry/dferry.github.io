<h3><a name="Course Description">Course Description</a></h3>



<p>Software engineering perhaps stands alone as a technical discipline in which
there are no universally accepted techniques (either in academia or industry)
that everyone agrees produces good software. Instead, there are a wide variety
of practices that have grown up around a diverse set of systems. Rather than
cataloguing all these techniques and attempting to prescribe their uses, we
will look at succesful case studies, listen to experienced veterans describe
their approaches, and try to develop an intuition of how large software
projects are run in practice. We will also get hands-on experience with the 
tools and techniques of a modern software development ecosystem, and put these
into practice in a semester-long team project.

<p>
The four elements of this course are class meetings, quizzes, exams, and a
project. This course will be taught as a graduate style seminar- some meeting 
times will be used for lecture, but out-of-class readings will also be the
basis for in-class discussions. Six quizzes will evaluate the student's
understanding of class readings, while the exams will assess your ability
to comprehensively integrate class topics. </p>


<p>The course project will be an exercise in agile software development
following the scrum process. We will discuss agile/scrum soon, but in short
effort on the project will be structured around two week sprints. You will
be evaluated at three milestones: an alpha product around midterms,
a beta product in early November, and a final release on the last day of
classes. You will be evaluated on the quality of your product and your
group's adherence to process, as well as your individual contributions.
Your individual performance will be evaluated by Git commit logs,
your participation in code reviews of others' commits, and peer evaluations
at the alpha/beta/final stages. </p> 

<p>
Definite topical outline:
<ul>
  <li>Software development processes
  <li>Agile and Scrum
  <li>Version control and branching
  <li>Software testing principles, test-driven development
  <li>Overview of software design and architecture
  <li>Code review process
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Tenative topics:
<ul>
  <li>Design patterns
  <li>Software packaging and publishing (e.g. Docker)

  <li>Designing and using libraries
  <li>Code standards
  <li>Technical debt and refactoring
  <li>Ethics in software development
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Assessment Objectives- at the completion of this course, students will be able to:
<ul>
  <li>Conduct a software development project as part of a team, using an agile process such as Scrum
  <li>Make effective use of a modern version control system
  <li>Use principles of software design in the implementation of a medium-to-large scale software project

<h3><a name="Studios">Studios</a></h3>

<p>Computer science is an eminently <i>practical</i> discipline, and
studios are daily assignments intended to complement and reinforce lectures
through practice.
Studios will be completed in a team of two students. Students from different
teams may discuss studios, but sharing of code or solutions is strictly
prohibited.</p>

<p>Studios are due approximately weekly. 
The midterm exam and other cirumstances
may modify this, see the complete course schedule below.</p> 

<p> 
Studios will be graded on a trimodal scale: complete, partial credit, or no credit.
Studios that are turned in late or not turned in at all will receive
no credit, studios graded as partial will receive 60% credit.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Labs">Labs</a></h3>

<p>There will be five lab assignments for this course. These are programming assignments whose purpose is to apply course concepts and to analyze operating system mechanisms. As such, each lab will require a written report detailing your findings in addition to a code submission.</p>

<p>Some labs will require a team of two students, while others are individual projects. Students from different teams may discuss the lab assignments <b>only during course meeting times</b>. Students from the same team are of course encouraged to discuss and work on lab assignments at any time. </p> 

<p>Labs submitted on time (as determined by electronic time stamp) are eligible for full credit. Labs submitted up to 24 hours late will be given a <b>ten percent penalty</b>. Labs submitted between 24 and 48 hours late will be given a <b>twenty percent penalty</b>. Labs submitted after 48 hours late will not be given credit, except in the case of extenuating circumstances pre-approved by the instructor.</p>

<h3><a name="Schedule">Course Schedule</a></h3>

<p>
A tentative course schedule is below. <b>Note that this schedule may change
over the course of the semester.</b> When changes occur, students will be 
given enough advance notice so that readings and 
other preparation may be accommodated. 
</p>

<p>The "Readings" field refers to material that will be discussed that day
in class, not homework for that day. For example, the readings for
August 29th will be discussed in class on August 29th. Readings should be
completed prior to coming to class for the day.</p>

<h3><a name="gitinfo">SLU Git Repository</a></h3>

<p>Version control software is used to track changes to all artifacts
related to this course. Most importantly this means project source
code, but you should track absolutely everything using version
control: data files, config files, build scripts, test code,
documentation, READMEs, licence files, project websites and
other resources, and so on.<p>

<p>Some things should not be tracked: generated files such as
intermediate compilation products and binary executable files bloat the
repository, and can't be used unless the server environment is totally
replicated by the user. Dependencies such as libraries should be indicated
and not replicated, unless you're willing to take on the challenge of
regularly updating and maintaining those libraries as well.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why version control is a universal software
development tool:
<ul>
  <li>Makes collaboration easier. Shared, up-to-date code base.
  <li>Tracks history of every change with log message explaininig the reason for it. 
  <li>Backup of all files. A single hard drive crash or backpack theft shouldn't kill your grade or bankrupt your startup.
  <li>Serve as a crude method of effort tracking.
  <li>Essential for debugging and “root cause analysis”. Find exact commit that introduced a given bug. Can "diff" between any two stored versions. 
  <li>Attributes every line to a feature or specification: most tools allow “blame view” - look at a file with each line annotated by the person who added that line and a reference to the commit that added.
  <li>Allows you to maintain multiple “branches” of a project. Stable branch, “next” branch for next stable release, “trunk” or bleeding edge branch, etc. We’ll do case studies of how different project handle this.
  <li>Branching allows fearless experimentation. Create a branch, try something and if it doesn’t work, discard the branch. If it does, “merge” in with the main development branch. And if you change your mind after merging, you can still “revert” at any time.
</ul>

<h3><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>

<p>The semester schedule for exams and quizzes is known well in advance. 
<b>Make up quizzes and exams will only be given for severe and documented reasons.</b>
Your lowest scoring quiz will be dropped.</p>

<p>Your grade will be determined as follows:</p>

<table border="3">

<p>Grading is done on a straight scale (uncurved). The following scores are guaranteed. The grading scale may be curved upwards (in your favor)
at the discretion of the instructor.

<ul>
<li> 93% guarantees an A
<li> 90% guarantees an A-
<li> 87% guarantees a B+
<li> 83% guarantees a B
<li> 80% guarantees a B-
<li> 77% guarantees a C+
<li> 73% guarantees a C
<li> 70% guarantees a C-
<li> 60% guarantees a D
</ul>

</p>

<p>Project work assigned for this course is generally expected to be
completed collaboratively. However, the sharing of written work or
code between teams is strictly prohibited. Exams and quizzes are individual
assignments and collaboration is strictly prohibited. Occasionally,
the readings for classes may include non-credit exercises designed to
inform or enhance your understanding of the material. These non-credit
exercises may be completed collaboratively. </p>

<p>Some specific guidelines for this course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code you submit as part of the project must be written by you or your team. You are not allowed to copy code. Copying code, even small portions, in an industrial setting can lead to
serious legal and financial consequences for both you and your employer.</li>
<li>Copying small pieces of code from man pages, online references or other sources is generally acceptable, but to be safe you should check with me first. <b>Code from such sources must be cited</b> with a comment denoting the start and finish of the copied section.</li>
<li>Copied code that is not cited will be considered plagiarism and will be treated as cheating. Citing your code protects you from this. However, copying large portions of code is still grounds for a reduction in grade, even if it is not cheating. Please check with the instructor if you are copying more than a few lines of code!  
</ul>

<a name="Attendance Policy">Attendance</a>
</H2>

<p>Successful students attend all or mostly all class sessions. This is true
in my experience <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187078">and has been demonstrated in large scale studies</a> as well.
In that study, even students who attended nine out of ten class periods had
measurably lower class performance than those who attended all classes. However,
there is no attendance requirement for this class, and you do not need to
get permission when you do miss class. You are an adult and have
the freedom to manage your time in whatever way you feel is most useful.
Job interviews, conferences, tests in other courses, etc. are all reasonable
cases for being absent.</p>

<p>Note that in-class assignments such as tests or quizes cannot be made
up outside of class without prior approval from the instructor. All such
activities will be listed course schedule with ample time to prepare
(i.e. there are no "pop quizes").</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, a portion of your project grade is adherence
to the scrum methodology. Sprint planning and review meetings are integral
to the scrum method and therefore your attendance at these class periods
will influence your grade.</p>

<p>If you do miss class you should refer to the course schedule to see what was
missed and arrange to get course notes from another student. I am always happy
to answer questions but I do not repeat full class periods in office hours.</p>

<P>
<em>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible
conduct in all academic endeavors.</em>
The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the
greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."
Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the
corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and
community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The
University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and
professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of
academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
</p>
<p>
The governing
University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring
2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: <a
href="https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf">https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own
academic integrity policies, available on their respective
websites. All SLU students are expected to know and abide by
these policies, which detail definitions of violations,
processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and
appeals. Please direct questions about any facet of academic
integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your
academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or
Center in which your program is housed. Specific College of Arts
and Sciences Academic Honesty Policies and Procedures may be
