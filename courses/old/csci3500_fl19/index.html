<h3><a name="Course Description">Course Description</a></h3>

<p>Operating systems are the bridge between computer hardware and the
software programs we create and use. As a concept, operating systems are one
of the oldest software disciplines, yet they continue to adapt and reinvent
themselves as the computing landscape evolves. Modern operating systems must
tackle the same challenges of the original mainframes, but must also meet the
varied needs of personal computers, severs, mobile/embedded devices, and
virtualized systems.</p>

<p>
The four elements of this course are lectures, studios, labs, and exams.
Studios are short assignments intended to be completed primarily within class
time and to augment lecture topics. Labs are longer assignments that will
ask students to apply and analyze OS mechanisms. Most class periods will
consist of a short lecture followed by studio time. Expect a lab assignment
approximately every two weeks.</p> 

<p>
Topical outline:
<ul>
  <li>The operating system, system libraries, and user applications
  <li>System calls and interrupts
  <li>User programs, processes, and threads
  <li>Processor sharing and operating system scheduling
  <li>Race conditions, locks, and mutual exclusion
  <li>The address space abstraction and virtual memory address translation
  <li>Virtual memory via paged memory and historical approaches
  <li>File systems and disk organization
  <li>7-layer OSI and 4-layer TCP/IP networking models
  <li>Sockets programming
  <li>Read, write, and execute permissions and institutional access models
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Assessment Objectives- at the completion of this course, students will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Describe how operating systems facilitate and interact with system libraries and user space programs
<li>Describe the purpose and implementation of major operating system abstractions: processes, threads, virtual memory, and the network stack
<li>Identify the presence/absence of race conditions and resolve race conditions with locking
<li>Write simple concurrent and multi-threaded programs (e.g. with <code>fork()</code> and Pthreads)
<li>Write simple networked programs (e.g. with sockets programming)
</ul>
</p>

<p><i><b>Catalog Description:</b>Theory and practice of operating systems, with emphasis on one of the UNIX family of operating systems. File organization and database systems. Focus on a multi-user system in the client-server model. Hands-on experience.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Studios">Studios</a></h3>

<p>Computer science is an eminently <i>practical</i> discipline, and
studios are daily assignments intended to complement and reinforce lectures
through practice.
Studios will be completed in a team of two students. Students from different
teams may discuss studios, but sharing of code or solutions is strictly
prohibited.</p>

<p>Studios are due Friday of the week after they are assigned. 
The midterm exam and other cirumstances
may modify this, see the complete course schedule below.</p> 

<p> 
Studios will be graded on a trimodal scale: complete, partial credit, or no credit.
Studios that are turned in late or not turned in at all will receive
no credit, studios graded as partial will receive 60% credit.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<h3><a name="Labs">Labs</a></h3>

<p>There will be five lab assignments for this course. These are programming assignments whose purpose is to apply course concepts and to analyze operating system mechanisms. As such, each lab will require a written report detailing your findings in addition to a code submission.</p>

<p>Some labs will require a team of two students, while others are individual projects. Students from different teams may discuss the lab assignments <b>only during course meeting times</b>. Students from the same team are of course encouraged to discuss and work on lab assignments at any time. </p> 

<p>Labs submitted on time (as determined by electronic time stamp) are eligible for full credit. Labs submitted up to 24 hours late will be given a <b>ten percent penalty</b>. Labs submitted between 24 and 48 hours late will be given a <b>twenty percent penalty</b>. Labs submitted after 48 hours late will not be given credit, except in the case of extenuating circumstances pre-approved by the instructor.</p>

<h3><a name="Schedule">Course Schedule</a></h3>

A tentative course schedule is below. <b>Note that this schedule may change
over the course of the semester.</b> When changes occur, students will be 
given enough advance notice so that readings and 
other preparation may be accommodated.

operating systems, with a bent towards Unix-like operating systems. This
book is not required for the course, rather it is a secondary source
of information that provides a more comprehensive textbook-like presentation
of the material. I will not be assigning homework from the book or taking
test questions from the book.</p>

<h3><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>

<p>There are three activities for which you will receive credit in this course: studios, labs, and exams. Studios are daily guided assignments primarily designed to familiarize students with course concepts and development tools (i.e. knowledge and comprehension tasks). Lab assignments will ask students to apply general course concepts and analyze OS design alternatives. A midterm and final exam will evaluate your technical understanding of course concepts.</p>

<p>Studios are graded on the following scale: complete, partial credit, or no credit. Studios will not be turned back with detailed comments. Labs and exams will be graded on a points scale and will be turned back with detailed comments.</p>

<p><b>Make up exams will only be given for severe and documented reasons.</b></p>

<p>Your grade will be determined as follows:</p>

<table border="3">
<tr>
	<th>Activity</th>
	<th>Grade Percentage</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Studios</td>
	<td>20%</td>

<tr>
	<td>Labs</td>
	<td>50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Midterm</td>
	<td>15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Final</td>
	<td>15%</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Grading is done on a straight scale (uncurved). The following scores are guaranteed. The grading scale may be curved upwards (in your favor)
at the discretion of the instructor.

<ul>
<li> 93% guarantees an A
<li> 90% guarantees an A-
<li> 87% guarantees a B+
<li> 83% guarantees a B
<li> 80% guarantees a B-
<li> 77% guarantees a C+
<li> 73% guarantees a C
<li> 70% guarantees a C-
<li> 60% guarantees a D
</ul>

</p>

<p>Most work assigned in this course, other than exams and some labs, is
expected to be completed collaboratively. Student teams may change from
assignment to assignment, but the sharing of written work or significant
portions of code between teams is strictly prohibited. </p>

<p>Some specific guidelines for this course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code you submit as solutions to the programming assignments must be written by you or your team. You are not allowed to copy code from other students.</li>
<li>Copying pieces of code from in-class examples is allowed, but <b>you must cite the source of such code</b> with a comment denoting the start and finish of the copied section.</li>
<li>Copying small pieces of code from man pages, online references or other sources is generally acceptable, but to be safe you should check with me first. <b>Code from such sources must be cited</b> with a comment denoting the start and finish of the copied section.</li>
<li>Copied code that is not cited will be considered plagiarism and will be treated as cheating. Citing your code protects you from this. However, copying large portions of code is still grounds for a reduction in grade, even if it is not cheating. Please check with the instructor if you are copying more than a few lines of code!

<a name="Attendance Policy">Attendance</a>
</H2>

<p>Successful students attend all or mostly all class sessions. This is true
in my experience <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187078">and has been demonstrated in large scale studies</a> as well.
In that study, even students who attended nine out of ten class periods had
measurably lower class performance than those who attended all classes. However,
there is no attendance requirement for this class, and you do not need to
get permission when you do miss class. You are an adult and have
the freedom to manage your time in whatever way you feel is most useful.
Job interviews, conferences, tests in other courses, etc. are all reasonable
cases for being absent.</p> 

<p>Note that in-class assignments such as tests or quizes cannot be made
up outside of class without prior approval from the instructor. All such
activities will be listed course schedule with ample time to prepare
(i.e. there are no "pop quizes").</p>

<p>If you do miss class you should refer to the course schedule to see what was
missed and arrange to get course notes from another student. I am always happy
to answer questions but I do not repeat full class periods in office hours.</p>

</H2>

<P>
<em>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible
conduct in all academic endeavors.</em>
The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the
greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."
Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the
corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and
community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The
University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and
professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of
academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
</p>
<p>
The governing
University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring
2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: <a
href="https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf">https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own
academic integrity policies, available on their respective
websites. All SLU students are expected to know and abide by
these policies, which detail definitions of violations,
processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and
appeals. Please direct questions about any facet of academic
integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your
academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or
Center in which your program is housed. Specific College of Arts
and Sciences Academic Honesty Policies and Procedures may be
