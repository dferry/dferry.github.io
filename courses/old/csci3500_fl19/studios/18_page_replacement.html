<h2 style="text-align: center;">Page Replacement Algorithms</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>When memory is full, a paged memory system must have a mechanism
in place to evict some page currently in memory. Ideally, this is
a page that is not currently needed by any process, and will not
be needed for a long while. To approximate this principle, a variety
of <i>page replacement algorithms</i> are used to guess at which
page in memory will be the least needed in the future.

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply the clarivoyant (optimal) page replacement algorithm
<li>Apply the FIFO page replacement algorithm
<li>Apply the LRU page replacement algorithm
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Suppose your machine has three physical page frames. At system start,
no frames contain any pages. Then, you run a program that makes
accesses that require the following pages. </p>

<p><code>A F B B C E A E D D C B B A F</code></p>

<p>Before considering any specific replacement algorithm, what is the
<i>minimum</i> number of page faults that will occur during this sequence?</p> 

<p><li>Compute the sequence of page faults using the clarivoyant (optimal)
algorithm. How many total faults occurred?</p>

<p><li>Compute the sequence of page faults using the FIFO algorithm.
How many total faults occurred?</p>

<p><li>Compute the sequence of page faults using the LRU algorithm.
How many total faults occurred?</p>

<p><li>Suppose your program is running slowly, and after some investigation
you realize that the program is generating a lot of page faults. Give
<b>two</b> possible solutions generating fewer page faults.</p>

<p><li>Suppose a smart programmer comes along and rearranges the accesses of
your program so that it now accesses pages in the following order:</P

<p><code>A F B B C C B B A E E D D A F</code></p>

<p>Why is this always advantageous, regardless of what page replacement
algorithm is used?</p>


<p><li>Suppose you're working with the following sequence of page accesses.
Assume again that your machine has three physical page frames.
Compute the number of faults using the FIFO algorithm:</p>

<p><code>D C B A D C E D C B A E</code></p>

<p><li>Thinking that you could make your program faster if you just spent a
little more money, you upgrade your machine so that it now has
four physical page frames. Re-compute the number of faults using the FIFO
algorithm.</p>

<p><li>Was the result from the last exercise expected or unexpected? Can you
explain the result?</p>

<p><li>This counter-intuitive result is called <i>Belady's Anomaly</i>. In
general, <i>anomalies</i> in computer science are results that show that an
intuitive solution to fixing a performance problem (i.e. add more memory, 
make the processor faster, reduce system utilization) can actually make things
worse than better.</p>

<p>Suppose you're paid the big bucks by a company to implement and maintain
performance-critical algorithms. Knowing what you know about the possibilities of
anomalies, how should you proceed when the company wants to buy new machines?</p>
