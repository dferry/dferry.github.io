<a name="Attendance Policy">Attendance</a>
</H2>

<p>Successful students attend all or mostly all class sessions. This is true
in my experience <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187078">and has been demonstrated in large scale studies</a> as well.
In that study, even students who attended nine out of ten class periods had
measurably lower class performance than those who attended all classes. However,
there is no attendance requirement for this class, and you do not need to
get permission when you do miss class. You are an adult and have
the freedom to manage your time in whatever way you feel is most useful.
Job interviews, conferences, tests in other courses, etc. are all reasonable
cases for being absent.</p> 

<p>Note that in-class assignments such as tests or quizes cannot be made
up outside of class without prior approval from the instructor. All such
activities will be listed course schedule with ample time to prepare
(i.e. there are no "pop quizes").</p>

<p>If you do miss class you should refer to the course schedule to see what was
missed and arrange to get course notes from another student. I am always happy
to answer questions but I do not repeat full class periods in office hours.</p>

</H2>

<P>
<em>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible
conduct in all academic endeavors.</em>
The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the
greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."
Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the
corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and
community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The
University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and
professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of
academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
</p>
<p>
The governing
University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring
2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: <a
href="https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf">https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own
academic integrity policies, available on their respective
websites. All SLU students are expected to know and abide by
these policies, which detail definitions of violations,
processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and
appeals. Please direct questions about any facet of academic
integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your
academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or
Center in which your program is housed. Specific College of Arts
and Sciences Academic Honesty Policies and Procedures may be
