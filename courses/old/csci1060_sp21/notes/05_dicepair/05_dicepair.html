Rolling Pairs of Dice
</H2>

<p>
If you roll a pair of dice, their sum will be a number from 2 to 12.
But the resulting numbers are not equally likely.  For example, you
are six times as likely to roll a score of 7 than a score of 2,
because there are six possible outcomes that add to 7&nbsp;<nobr>(1+6,
2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1)</nobr> yet only one outcome to 
achieve 2&nbsp(1+1).  In fact, the expected probabilities of the
various outcomes is well known to be

<table cellpadding=7>
  <tr>
    <th>outcome:</th>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>probability:</th>
    <td>1/36</td>
    <td>2/36</td>
    <td>3/36</td>
    <td>4/36</td>
    <td>5/36</td>
    <td>6/36</td>
    <td>5/36</td>
    <td>4/36</td>
    <td>3/36</td>
    <td>2/36</td>
    <td>1/36</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>
Today, we will develop a program that performs an experiment by
simulating N trials of rolling a pair of dice, and graphing a
histogram of the outcomes versus the theoretical prediction.
We will rely on MATLAB's existing <tt>hist</tt> function, for
producing such a figure. As an example, here is a graph of 1000 random
trials.

<p>
Our goal is to write a script <tt>dicepair.m</tt> that produces such
a figure, assuming that variable <tt>N</tt> is predefined to be the
number of trials.  We will work on this as a group.  After class, I
will post a sample solution.
