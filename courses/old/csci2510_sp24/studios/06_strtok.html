<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 2510: Studio 6<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Parsing String Input</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">


<p>Parsing input in C is initially more difficult than in other,
higher level, languages. However, the C library includes a wide variety
of functions that make input handling straightforward after you've
spent a little time in practice.


<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get user input with <code>fgets()</code>
	<li>Parse the input string with <code>strtok()</code>
	<li>Pack input data into your own <code>char* argv[]</code> structure
	<li>Execute programs with <code>execvp()</code>
</ol>

<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file. When finished, submit your work via the Git repository.</p> 

<!--by sending your text file and
source code to <strong>dferry_submit@slu.edu</strong>
with the phrase <strong>
String Input
</strong> in the subject line.</p>-->

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Write a short program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompts the user to enter input
<li>Gets user input using the function <code>fgets()</code>
<li>Prints the user input back to the console with <code>printf("%s\n", input_string)</code>
</ol>

<p>See the man page for <code>fgets()</code> for more detail. You will need to
declare a sufficiently large <code>char buffer[]</code> to store user input, 
and you should read from the standard input stream ('<code>stdin</code>').</p>

<p>Copy and paste the output of your program once it runs correctly.</p>

<p><li>Now we want to parse the input string and divide it into individual
<i>tokens</i>. For this we can use the function <code>strtok()</code>, which
parses a string from left to right and returns one token each time you call
the function. Pull up
the <code>strtok()</code> manual page and read the first paragraph. What
difference is there between the initial call to <code>strtok()</code>
and subsequent calls that parse the same string?</p>

<p><li>The <i>delimiter</i> character tells the <code>strtok()</code> function
which character marks the boundary of tokens. What delimiter character
should you use for regular text input?</p>


<p><li>Make a call to <code>strtok()</code> so that your program parses
the first token from the user input. Print this first token on a new line.</p>

<p>Copy and paste your program output once this works correctly.</p>


<p><li>Now use an appropriate loop so that your program parses and prints
each token in the user input on a separate line. Copy and paste your program
output once this is done.</p>


<p><li>One strange artifact you might notice is an extra newline that is
printed after the last token. This is because your input string automatically
contains a new line character at its end. For example, if you enter:</p>

<p><code>This is an input string.</code></p>

<p>The actual string recieved by your program is:</p>

<p><code>"This is an input string.\n"</code></p>

<p>We want to <i>strip</i> this trailing newline character, as it will cause
problems for us later. There are a variety of approaches to doing this, such
as using the <code>strlen()</code> or <code>strchr()</code> functions, or even 
the <code>strtok()</code> function itself. Modify your program to strip the
newline character after your call to <code>fgets()</code>, but before you start
parsing. Try a Google search for "strip newline character in C" if you would
like some further inspiration.</p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste your newline stripping
code.</p>

<p><li>Lastly, we want to re-purpose this studio program as a springboard
to executing arbitrary programs for Lab 2. Rather than just tokenizing
input for the fun of it, we will now modify the studio so that it interprets
our input as a program to execute. For example, if the user inputs the string
<code>"ls -l"</code> then your program should execute the command <code>
ls -l</code>. We will use the function <code>execvp()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>execvp()</code> function takes two arguments. First, a <code>char*</code>
that contains the command we want to execute (e.g. <code>"ls"</code> from
above). Second, a <code>char* argv[]</code> structure.</p>

<p>Declare the following variables and leave this answer blank.</p>

<p><code>int max_args = 15;</code><br>
<code>int max_argv_size = max_args + 2; //one for argv[0], one for null terminator</code><br>
<code>char* cmd;</code><br>
<code>char* my_argv[max_argv_size];</code></p>

<p><li>Filling out the <code>cmd</code> variable is easy. This will always
be the first token returned from <code>strtok()</code>. Note that
<code>strtok()</code> returns a <code>char*</code> and this is exactly
the type we have declared for <code>cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Copy and paste your assignment statement as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>Filling out <code>my_argv</code> is slightly trickier. First, observe
that <code>my_argv</code> is simply an array of <code>char*</code> pointers.
Second, recall that the regular <code>argv</code> variable always has the
name of the command as the first element (<code>argv[0]</code>), and is always
terminated by a NULL character.</p>

<p>Start by assigning "<code>my_argv[0] = cmd;</code>". Then, parse the 
rest of the user
input string and assign each subsequent token to each subsequent position. For
example, if the result of <code>strtok()</code> is stored as such:</p>

<p><code>res = strtok(NULL, " ");</code></p>

Then assign each token thusly, for an appropriate value of <code>i</code>:

<p><code>my_argv[i] = res;</code></p>

<b>
<p>IMPORTANT: After there are no more tokens to parse, assign the next element of
<code>my_argv</code> the NULL character:</p>

<p><code>my_argv[after_last] = '\0';</code></p>
</b>

<p>Copy and paste your <code>my_argv[]</code> code as the answer.</p>

<p><li>Lastly, after you have constructed <code>cmd</code> and
<code>my_argv</code>, insert the following call to <code>execvp()</code>:</p>

<p><code>execvp( cmd, my_argv );</code></p>

<p>If the two variables are constructed correctly, your program should read
the user input, parse it as though it were a new program to execute, and then
execute that program with <code>execvp()</code></p>

<p>Copy and paste a working output as the answer to this question.</p>
