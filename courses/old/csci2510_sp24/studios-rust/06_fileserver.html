<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 2510: Studio 6<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fileserver</h2>

<p>Network programming sounds intimidating, but a large number of useful
programs are actually quite small and achievable. In this studio, you will
use the code we developed in class to create a simple fileserver. You will
have two projects: <code>sever</code> and <code>client</code>. The first
will wait for a filename, attempt to open the file, and if successful,
print the contents of the file back to a client. The second will send
a filename, and then wait for a response.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a server using <code>std::net::TcpListener</code></li>
	<li>Create a client using <code>std::net::TcpStream</code></li>
	<li>Correctly error check the various network and file operations</li>
	<li>Send data from the client to the server, and send a response from
		the server to the client</li>
</ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
For this studio, please create a new directory inside your Git repository
called <strong>fileserver</strong>. Then, create two Rust projects with names 
<strong>server</strong> and <strong>client</strong> (note, case sensitive). 
As you work through these exercises, 
please record your answers in a text file in the root level of that
project. When finished, please add the entire project and push it
to the SLU Git repository.

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
	<li><p>There are no questions for this studio, you only need to
		produce and upload the <code>client</code> and
		<code>server</code> programs.</p></li>

	<li><p>First we will work on the server. You may use any of
		the code we have developed previously, either
		in the studios or in class together. Remember that
		our class discussion showed how to create a basic
		server and client, and remember that Studio 4 - 
		<code>print_file</code> already prints the contents
		of a whole file to standard output.</p>

		<p>Start by creating a basic server that listens
	on IP address 127.0.0.1 and a port number of your choosing.
	Then, have the server <code>accept()</code> connections in
	a forever-loop. Remember to use <code>std::net::TcpListener</code>
	to put your program into listening mode.</li>

	<li><p>Now we will create a basic client. Again, feel free to reuse any
		code from the course thus far. Your client should use
		<code>std::net::TcpStream::connect()</code> to establish
		a connection to the server at IP address 127.0.0.1 and the
		port number you have chosen. 
		</p></li>

	<li><p>When the client calls <code>connect()</code>, that
		will cause the server to <code>accept()</code> the
		incoming connection and move past the blocking
		call to <code>accept()</code>. Verify this happens
		by printing out statements at the top and bottom
		of your loop in the server. If you connect multiple
		times with different clients, each should result in
		a separate successful <code>accept()</code>.</p></li>


	<li><p>Now modify your client- when it 
		<code>connect()</code>s, it waits for the user
		to enter a filename from standard input, 
		and then writes it to the server
		through the TcpStream object.</p>

		<p>Note that you should be careful that your filename
		string does not contain the newline character. If your
		filename is in a <code>String</code> you can use the
		<code>trim()</code> method to remove trailing newlines.</p>

		<p>Use the <code>TcpStream::write()</code> function,
		and note that this takes an array of bytes (<code>&amp;[u8]</code>).
		Also note that your message may not be sent immediately, so
		follow your <code>write()</code> call with a call to
		<code>TcpStream::flush()</code>.</li>

	<li><p>Have your server read from the <code>TcpStream</code> object
		that was returned from <code>accept()</code>. 
		Print out the message recieved- it should be the filename
		what was sent by the client program. Again- double
		check here that there are no newlines or other unexpected
		characters, as these will cause the open file function to
		fail.</p></li>

	<li><p>Have your server use the recieved message as a filename
		and attempt to open that file using <code>File::open()</code>
		make sure your filename does not contain the newline
		character or other unwanted extra characters.</p></li>

	<li><p>If the file open succeeds, your server should read the entire
		file and write it to the <code>TcpStream</code> object. If
		opening the file fails, you should write a descriptive
		error message to the client. Hint: use a <code>match</code>
		statement on the <code>File::open()</code> command.
		Another Hint: First have your server print these things
		to standard output so you can see what is happening,
		then write them to the <code>TcpStream</code>.
		Third hint: use File::read_to_string() to read
		the entire file into a string, and then the 
		<code>TcpStream::write_all()</code>
		function to write the entire function to the network
		in a single function call.</p></li>

	<li><p>Then, your server should call <code>TcpStream::shutdown()</code>
		and go back to the top of its loop to accept a new
		connection.</p></li>

	<li><p>In the client, after writing the filename input to the
		server, it should try to read the response from the
		server and print it to standard output.</p></li>

	<li><p>Lastly, your client may get multiple messages from the
		server. Instead of just reading once, use the function
		<code>TcpStream::read_to_string()</code> which will
		continue reading until it gets EOF, which means that
		the server has called <code>shutdown()</code> on the
		connection.</p></li>

	<li><p>Make a few test files of varying size and contents.
		Verify that your server can handle multiple
		connections from different clients in sequence.
		Check that your server returns the correct results each 
		time. Lastly, make sure your server returns an
		appropriate error message when the client's input
		cannot be opened.</p></li>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Modify your server so that when it
		recives the string "ls" from the client, it
		invokes the "ls" command locally to show a list
		of all files in the program's current directory,
		and then returns that as output to the client.
		This allows the client to query the server as to
		what files are available for transmission.</p></li>
