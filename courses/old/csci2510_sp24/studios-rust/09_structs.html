<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
	<li><p>"Object-oriented programming" can mean a lot of things- inheritance,
		abstract interfaces, polymorphism, and more. At its core, OOP
		says that we should package data and code that operates on that
		data together. This principle creates programs out of cleanly separated
		logical units rather than a spaghetti pile of data and code.
		That core concept is considered essential in modern programming,
		but if you look
		through the Rust documentation, they don't talk about objects,
		classes, or inheritance structures. What gives?</p>

		<p>What's your gut reaction to the phrase "object-oriented
		programming? What comes to mind?</p></li>

		<p>Rust, as usual, is <i>opinionated</i>. Rust does support 
		some object-oriented principles, but does not support the same
		object-oriented tools seen in languages like Java and Python.
		I like to describe Rust as being data-focused rather than object-focused,
		which I think leads to programmers thinking harder about how, when, and
		where data is allocated, moved, and transformed. A Rust programmer thinks
		about the data first and builds
		an object structure to support the efficient management of their data.
		A traditional Object-Oriented approach would start with the object
		and inheritance structure, and then work to fit an efficient implementation
		within that structure. Both are appropriate ways to approach a system
		building task, but both have tradeoffs.</p>

		<p>Brainstorm: What are the benefits of starting a project by thinking about the
		object structure? What are the benefits of starting a project by thinking about
		the underlying data?</p></li>

		<li><p><i>Gedankenexperiment:</i> 
		Suppose you are creating a program that contains an abstract
		<code>car</code> object with configurable components, such as
		different engines, tires, etc. Briefly describe what the object
		heriarchy for such a <code>car</code> would look like.</p></li>		

		<li><p><i>Gedankenexperiment:</i>
		Now suppose I ask you to calculate how long it takes to drive your
		car from St. Louis to Chicago. How does this functionality interact
		with your object heriarchy?</p></li>

		<p>To go a little bit deeper, Rust's object model is very much
		composition-based rather than inheritance-based. I won't elaborate
		more on this now, but I'd encourage you to revisit the thought
		as you do more programming in both Rust and other languges.</p>

		<p>What are you opinionated about? 
		What do you like about object-oriented programming?
	        What do you dislike?</li>


	<li><p>In math, a Disc is the region bounded by a circle. In other words, 
		a disc is a "filled-in" circle. We will implement a Disc object
		and create a few methods to make using such discs convenient.</p>

		<p>Rust allows you to create a set of related data values with the
		<code>struct</code> keyword. Look up how <code>struct</code> is
		used, and then define a struct called Disc that holds three values:
		<code>x: f32, y: f32, radius: f32</code>. Those are the x-position,
		y-position, and radius of the disc. The <code>f32</code> type is a
		32-bit (single precision) floating point number.<p></li>

	<li><p>Declare three discs and print them out. Rust doesn't automatically
		provide an easy way to print out a struct, but since our data is
		simple we can use a handy shortcut. Add <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code>
		immediately above your struct definition and Rust will derive a
		debug print for us. (Remember how I said Rust objects are
		composition-based? Because each data element in Disc has the
		debug-print trait, the composition of these elements can also
		automatically satisfy the debug-print trait.)</p>

	<p>Remember that you debug-print with the <code>{:?}</code> specifier.
	For example: <code>println!("My struct: {:?}", my_disc);</code></p></li>

	<li><p>Take one of your discs from above and modify its data.
		You can access members of a struct with the dot notation.
		Print out the disc before and after to verify that you've changed
		the data inside the struct.</p></li>

	<li><p>To really make an object (data + code) we have to implement a method
		on our struct. This is the purpose of the <code>impl</code> keyword.
		Below is an example of declaring a method called <code>resize</code>
		on the Disc struct. This method should take a value called <code>scale</code>, and
		changes the size of the disc using this as a multiplier. For example,
		if the original radius is 1.5, and the scale is 3.0, then the scale
		after resizing will be 1.5*3.0 = 4.5:</p>

<pre>
impl Disc {
	//Declare the scale method
	pub fn resize( &amp;mut self, scale: f32 ) {
		//Write the code that implments the scale method
	}
}
</pre>

	<p>Note several things. The <code>pub</code> keyword declares this as a public
	method, so it can be called by other code modules. Second, we explicitly pass
	in <code>self</code> as a parameter- as in some other languages, this refers
	to the struct that we call the method on.</p>

	<p>Implement the scale method, and call it on one of your discs from above and
	verify it works.</p>
	</li>

	<li><p>Implement another method called <code>offset</code>. This should
		take three parameters: <code>self</code>, <code>x_offset: f32</code>,
		and <code>y_offset: f32</code>. This can be thought of translating
		or moving the disc. For example, if the disc starts at the origin
		at point <code>(0.0, 0.0)</code>, then <code>disc.offset(2.0,-3.0)</code>
		should modify the disc so that it is now at point <code>(2.0,-3.0)</code></p>

	<p>Test the method by calling it and printing out the before and after.</p></li>

	<li><p>Lastly, implement a method called <code>intersects_with</code> that
		takes two parameters- <code>self</code> and a reference to another
		disc. This method should return <code>true</code> when they intersect
		in at least one point, and false otherwise.</p>

		<p>Two discs touch at a single point when the distance between their
		centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Two discs overlap each other
		significantly when that distance is less than the sum of their radii, and
		two discs don't intersect at all when that distance is greater than the
		sum of their radii.</p>

		<p>Implement and print out the result of the following three test cases,
		which should be true, true and false:</p>

<pre>
    let mut d1 = Disc{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius:1.0 };
    let mut d2 = Disc{ x: 2.0, y: 0.0, radius:1.0 };
    println!("{:?} and {:?} intersect: {}", d1, d2, d1.intersects_with(&amp;d2) );

    let mut d1 = Disc{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius:1.0 };
    let mut d2 = Disc{ x: 2.0, y: 0.0, radius:2.0 };
    println!("{:?} and {:?} intersect: {}", d1, d2, d1.intersects_with(&amp;d2) );

    let mut d1 = Disc{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius:1.0 };
    let mut d2 = Disc{ x: 5.0, y: 0.0, radius:1.0 };
    println!("{:?} and {:?} intersect: {}", d1, d2, d1.intersects_with(&amp;d2) );
</pre>
	</li>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>So far, basic data and code encapsulation isn't all that different from
	other object-oriented languages. Implment the same program in Python, Java, or
	any other OOP language and compare and contrast.</p></li>
