<p>Concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems all run the risk of <i>deadlock</i>
whenever the possibility of <i>circular waiting</i> exists. We commonly think of
deadlock occuring when doing explicit locking operations, but deadlock also occurs in
any situation when wait dependencies can occur only incidentally- e.g. such as waiting for a
remote client to finish responding to a network request. To this end, such systems
must be aware of and guard themselves against possible sources of deadlock.</p>

<p>Practical methods for dealing with deadlock exist- such as <i>avoidance</i> and 
<i>detection</i>. However, in many of these solutions the system must be able to
analyze a <i>dependency</i> or <i>waits-for</i> graph of the system and identify
whether or not deadlock has occurred. To this end, a <i>deadlock detection</i>
algorithm must be available. In this lab, we will create such a deadlock detection
utility that we will then use later in our system.
</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Implement your own graph data structure in Rust.</li>
	<li>Analyze a graph for cycles.</li>
	<li>Build a dependency graph from a sequence of <i>request</i>
		and <i>release</i> directives.</li>
</ol>

<p><h3>Lab Format</h3></p>

<p>This is an individual assignment. Discussion with other students is
permitted, but sharing code is strictly prohibited.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Packages to Implement</h3></p>
<p><code>deadlock_detect</code> - a library package that provides functions for creating an
empty dependency graph, adding processes and resources to the graph, adding and managing
edges in the graph, and running a deadlock detection algorithm</p>

<p><h3>Key Concepts</h3></p>
<p><code>struct</code> - encapsulates a collection of data together in Rust</p>
<p><code>impl</code> - implements callable methods on a struct, Rust's version of objects</p>
<p><code>Box</code> - heap allocator in Rust</p>

<p><h3>deadlock_detect</h3></p>
<p>This component is a library component that implements a deadlock detection algorithm.
As this is a public interface, I have created a skeleton for you in the following file:
<a href="./lib_deadlock_detect.rs">lib_deadlock_detect.rs</a>. You may add non-public functions,
but do not add public functions to this interface.</p>

<p>Upon encountering any error, print a descriptive message and panic.</p>

<p>For an example of usage, the following sequence creates a deadlock:</p>

<pre>
let mut detector = DeadlockDetector::new();

detector.add_process("procA");
detector.add_process("procB");
detector.add_resource("resC");
detector.add_resource("resD");

let result = detector.request("procA","resC"); //OK
assert!(result); //should be true
let result = detector.request("procB","resD"); //OK
assert!(result); //should be true
let result = detector.request("procA","resD"); //OK
assert!(result); //should be true
let result = detector.request("procB","resC"); //Deadlock
assert!(result); //should fail
</pre>


<p><h3>Graph structure</h3></p>

<p>You are free to implement your graph structure how you see fit. <b>However,
you must implment your own data structure- not use an existing crate from
crates.io.</b> Given that our graph can grow over time, an adjacency matrix
approach would be difficult, so an adjacency list approach might be easier.
Remember that you can implement your "list" as a real list, but a hash map
is probably easier and more efficient in practice.</p>

<p><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>

<p>Before getting started, you will need to create a deadlock_detect library package
and add it to your workspace for <code>slumcs</code>.
Inside the <code>slumcs</code> directory, your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file 
should have at least the following contents:</p>

<pre>
[workspace]

members = [
        "log_component",
        "send_log",
	"test_logger",
	"deadlock_detect"
]
</pre>

<p>Then, you can create the project for this lab with the following cargo command.</p>

<pre>
cargo new deadlock_detect --lib
</pre>

<p>Because <code>deadlock_detect</code> is a library instead of an executable project,
the default filename in <code>/deadlock_detect/src/</code> is <code>lib.rs</code> instead
of <code>main.rs</code>. Please remember to use the public interface given above for
this file.</p>

<p><h3>Testing</h3></p>

<p>Testing is easier than ever! For this lab, we are using Rust and Cargo's built in
unit test feature. The <code>lib_deadlock_detect.rs</code> skeleton includes a set
of unit tests that create a variety of deadlock graphs both with and without
cycles. See the comments for more details.</p>

<p>Simply type <code>cargo test</code> while in your <code>deadlock_detect</code>
project directory, and cargo will automatically run the functions in the
<code>test</code> module that are marked with the <code>#[test]</code>
identifier. Each of these will build a deadlock graph and <code>assert!()</code>
the correct true/false result after each edge is added.</p>

<p>By default, <code>cargo test</code> hides output for successful tests and
emits output for failed tests. If you think you're missing output and want to
force output, you can use the command:</p>
<p><code>cargo test -- --nocapture</code></p>

<p>Please note the double <code>--</code> in that command is intended.</p>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>
<p><ol>
	<li>You must use the interface I have specified for <code>send_log</code>,
		but you can structure <code>log_component</code> however you would
		like.</li>
	<li><code>log_component</code> needs to have a <code>main()</code> function
		and produce an executable. <code>send_log</code> is a library
		and does not produce an executable.</li>
	<li>When opening the log file, make sure to (1) create it if necessary and
		(2) open it in append mode so as to not overwrite existing data.</li>
	<li>The <code>log_component</code> will end up checking all connected clients
		in a loop of some kind- but you should use <code>thread::sleep</code>
		in that loop so that it is not running continuously at 100% CPU
		utilization.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind move semantics and ownership when you manage the lifetime
		of your <code>TcpStream</code> objects. Ultimately these should
		"live" on a dynamically resizable data structure such as a
		list or a vector.</li>
	<li>Make sure you set the <code>config</code> crate as a dependency in
		both the <code>send_log</code> and <code>log_component</code>
		projects. See the examples above for how to use the crate.</li>

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the name(s) of the people who
worked together on this lab.</p>

<p><li>This compression technique works well in some cases, and poorly in
others. Give an example of each.</p>

<p><li>The <i>compression ratio</i> can be computed as (size before compression)/(size after compression).
For example if the original file size is 20,000 bytes and the compressed size is
15,000 bytes then the compression ratio is 1.33. There are three files above of size
one million bytes each: 1mil_random, 1mil_weak_bias, and 1mil_strong_bias. Each of
these files contains the numbers 0-4 in random order, but the random file contains all numbers distrbuted
evenly, while the weak and strong bias files shift the distribution so that the lower number
values occur more often. For example, zero occurs about 20% of the time in the random
file, about 75% of the time in the weak bias file, and about 90% of the time in the
strong bias file.</p>

<p>Which file do you think will compress best? Compute the compression ratio for each file with a compression length of one.</p>

<p><li>The Bash shell includes the nifty command <code>time</code>, which records how
long a command runs. Record how long it takes to compress the file <code>test4</code>.
The syntax in this case is "<code>time ./rle test4 output 1 0</code>". 
This will report three measurements: real, user,
and sys. How long does your program take to run in real time? 

<p><li>Try the above command again but with a compression length of ten, how
long does your program take now? Which operations happen more or less
frequently now? Formulate a hypothesis as to the difference.</p>

<p><li>Indicate which, if any, extra credit exercises have you have attempted.</p>
</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>3% Extra Credit</b>: Download the slu_logo.bmp file above,
this is an uncompressed image file. Compress the file, then uncompress it. 
Verify that you can still open the
image in a photo viewer and that it is not distorted.</p>

<p>The compression algorithm you have implemented
is a form of lossless compression, meaning that the entire uncompressed
file can be reconstructed and no data is lost. This approach works well
for highly structured data with lots of repitition. This can happen
naturally in a case like slu_logo.bmp, where the whole image has just a
few colors and lots of large same-color regions. Compute the compression
ratio of your algorithm with slu_logo.bmp. Then, open the file in a
photo editor (such as Microsoft Paint, Photoshop, or GIMP) and save it
as a .png file (lossless compression) and a .jpg file (lossy compression).
Compute the compression ratio for each method.</p> 

<p><li><b>2% Extra Credit</b>: As it turns out, lossy compression can be far
more effective in some situations than lossless compression. Compression algorithm
researchers are very skilled at removing data that is virtually imperceptible.
Download <a href="lab1/uncompressed.bmp">this file</a> and compute the
compression ratio using your algorithm. Then, use a standard photo editor
from before to generate a losslessly compressed .png file and a lossily compressed 
.jpg file and compute their compression ratios. Inspect the files carefully,
are you able to discern a difference between the three?</p>
