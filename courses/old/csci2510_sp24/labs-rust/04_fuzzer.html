<p>
Many code vulnerabilities are related to cases where software fails to handle
malformed or unexpected input properly. Typically, it is at least
tractable to check the functional requirements of a program. (I.e. the program
does what it is supposed to do.) However, it is difficult to impossible to
verify that a program never does anything it is not supposed to do. 
In this lab we will explore a basic technique used by software developers and
security professionals to ensure robust code quality, or used by bad actors
to find code vulnerabilities to exploit. 

<p>
In <i>fuzzing</i>, many malformed inputs are generated and sent into a
program. The goal is to test how well the program handles these abnormal
conditions. Robust software will produce descriptive error messages
indicating what is unexpected and will quit gracefully. Insecure software
will simply crash with segmentation faults, core dumps, aborts, or other
uncontrolled program terminations.

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a target program to fuzz
<li>Generate random malformed or invalid inputs
<li>Submit malformed inputs to a target program
<li>Evaluate target program performance
</ol>

<p><h3>Lab Format</h3></p>

<p>This is an individual assignment. Discussion with other students is
permitted, but sharing code is strictly prohibited.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Program to Implement</h3></p>
<p><code>fuzzer</code> - a runnable file that generates a series of malformed inputs,
then runs the target program using those malformed inputs. This file can be entirely
hard-coded for your specific target program. You do not need to write a general-purpose
fuzzing framework.</p>

<p>When your program is run with <code>cargo run</code>, it should generate at least
100 malformed inputs and run the target program for each. Your program should print 
any error output that is produced, but it may redirect or suppress standard program
outputs if you want.</p>


<p><h3>Key Concepts</h3></p>

<p><h4>Error Handling vs. Crashing</h4></p>

<p>The goal of a fuzzer is primarily to find programs that do not handle exceptional
situations appropriately. Feeding malformed input to a program is not expected to
produce useful output. Errors like, "Invalid File Format" are normal and good behavior
during fuzzing, as they indicate that the program under test recognizes the abnormal
condition and terminates gracefully. In contrast, errors like segmentation faults,
core dumps, aborts, or other forceful program terminations indicate a failure to handle
abnormal conditions.</p>

<p>Ideally, a fuzzer should detect such abnormal terminations and log the inputs for
later analysis. This is not required for this lab. If you were interested, Rust can
be used to detect why a program terminates in Linux using
<code>std::os::unix::process::ExitStatusExt</code>. Note that this code will probably
not be platform-independent.</p>

<p><b>Your program does not need to find such vulnerabilities to qualify for credit.</b>
Many "core" utilities have already be extensively fuzz-tested. However, your program
must demonstrate that it is testing some interesting program behavior beyond
surface level- i.e. beyond simply checking for valid command line argument names
or for valid magic bytes in binary files.</p>

<p><h4>Target Selection</h4></p>

<p>For our purposes in this lab, you should select (1) a program that exists on Hopper,
our shared system, and (2) a program that can be tested from
the command line. Such programs can be run and interacted with easily from Rust.
Other programs, such as those with network interfaces or graphical interfaces,
can be fuzz tested, but require more complicated setup and frameworks.</p>

<p>You also need to decide what kind of input you would like to fuzz. For command-line
utilities, this is mostly command-line arguments or input files. Each of these target
types entail different fuzzing strategies. See the Input Generation section for more.</p>

<p>Some ideas for programs that could be fuzzed. Play around with a few such programs
and consider what it would take to generate reasonable but random inputs for each program. 
Note in particular that you are not required to exhaustively test all features of these
programs. Some programs may be fuzzed in multiple ways- for example, an image processor
might be fuzzed by modifying the input image, or by generating combinations of command
line arguments.</p>

<p><h4>Input Generation</h4></p>

<p>For the purpose of this lab, we will describe three types of input generation strategies. Your
goal should be to expose interesting behavior of the program, and one of the challenges in fuzzing
is getting your fuzzer to test behavior below "surface level."</p>

<p>For command line argument fuzzing, we don't want to generate random strings at random.
Most programs use well-tested, standard libraries for handling complex command line arguments,
so random strings only trigger a surface-level error message followed by a quit. For example, the
"ls" program lists programs in a directory, and "ls -l -h" lists all programs in long-list format
with human-readable numbers. We could fuzz this program by looking up a list of all command line
arguments and randomly generating lists of arguments to pass. If we pick a command line
argument totally at random, like "ls -doesnotexist" then the program just returns
"unrecognized option".</p>

<p>For binary input files, such as images or compressed files, 
generating a file totally at random is unlikely to get below surface-level behavior 
for essentially the same reason as before. For example, the "readelf" utility looks
at the first four bytes of a file to determine if the file is in the ELF format,
and if not it prints the error, "Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start."
Instead, our approach here is to find a valid binary file that could be used as input,
and then permute that input in various ways. We could generate malformed inputs by
randomly selecting and modifying existing bytes in the file, randomly adding extra bytes,
or randomly subtracting bytes.</p>

<p>For structured text files, such as JSON or HTML files, we might want to use a
content-aware fuzzer. It still makes sense to start with a valid input file,
but rather than randomly permuting at a byte level, we can randomly permute at
a semantic level. For example, for an HTML file, we could add or subtract HTML tags at random,
or we could even parse the HTML heirarchy and do things like swap subtrees around.</p>

<p><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>

<p>Before getting started, you will want to create a <code>fuzzer</code> package, 
and add them to your workspace for <code>slumcs</code>.
Inside the <code>slumcs</code> directory, your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file 
would have at least the following contents:</p>

<pre>
[workspace]

members = [
        "log_component",
        "send_log",
	"test_logger",
	"deadlock_detect",
	"crack",
	"hash_demo",
	"fuzzer"
]
</pre>

<p>Then, you can create the project for this lab with the following cargo command.</p>

<pre>
cargo new fuzzer
</pre>

<p>We don't have any framework code to get you started this time, but you can use
the discussion we had in class as a starting point. Remember that your code can
be relatively hard-coded for this lab, and that it only needs to run 100 iterations
of some fuzzing process when I issue the "cargo run" command. There are no specific
test cases your code must pass.

<p>If you use external crates in your fuzzer, make sure to add the dependencies 
to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and push those changes to your repository.</p>

<p><h3>Submission</h3></p>

<p>More than any other assignment, please verify that your code builds and
runs when checked out of a <i>fresh repository</i>. Your fuzzer should
run successfully "out of the box" when I issue the "cargo run" command
for the first time in your /slumcs/fuzzer/ directory. This means that 
any supporting files must be correctly uploaded to your repository
(such as valid images, text files, or other starting points for
generating malformed inputs), and your
cargo workspace in /slumcs/Cargo.toml must be configured correctly.</p>

<p>To test this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Upload everything you think you need for your final submission</li>
	<li>Login to hopper.slu.edu</li>
	<li>Check out a fresh copy of your Git repository with "git clone" in
	a new location (not inside your existing Git repository)</li>
	<li>Navigate to /slumcs/fuzzer/ in the freshly cloned repository</li>
	<li>Issue the "cargo run" command</li>
	<li>Verify your code builds and runs on Hopper</li>
</ol>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/index.html"><code>std::process</code> module</a> is used to create and wait for processes.</li>

	<li><code>std::process::Command</code> is used to create a child process and pass
		command line arguments to it.</li>

	<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.output">
	<code>Command.output()</code> method</a> spawns a process and waits for it
	to finish, and returns all output the process produced. You can separate this output
	by standard error and standard output.</li>

	<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.spawn">
	<code>Command.spawn()</code> method</a> creates a child process and returns immediately.
	You will need to wait for the child process to terminate, similar to how we have used
	joins to wait for threads to terminate. This is done with the 
	<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Child.html">
		<code>Child.wait()</code> method</a>. This can be more efficient than
	<code>Command.output()</code>, but efficiency is not a grading criteria for this lab.</li>

</ul>
