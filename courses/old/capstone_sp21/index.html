</H2>

<p>
The Capstone Project serves as a
concluding achievement for graduating students, allowing them to apply knowledge that they have gained 
from the Computer Science curriculum toward a year-long
project. Formally, the project is completed as part of a two-semester
sequence of 2-credit courses: CSCI&nbsp;4961 (Capstone
Project&nbsp;I) and CSCI&nbsp;4962 (Capstone Project&nbsp;II).
</p>

<H2>Graduate Overview</H2>

<p>The Capstone Project serves as a concluding achievement for graduating students,
allowing them to apply knowledge that they have gained from the Computer Science
curriculum toward a semester-long project. Formally, the project is completed
in one semester as a 3-credit course: CSCI&nbsp;5960 (Capstone Project).

<HR>
<H2>
<A name="outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</A>
</H2>

<p>
After successfully completing this course sequence, students will be able to:
<ol>
<li> Communicate with a client regarding project requirements and
  formally document the requirement specifications.</li>

<li> Develop a project design and plan, including reasonable timeline
  and effort estimates.</li>

<li> Design, implement and test a medium- to large-scale software
product which meets given requirements specifications.</li>

<li> Use a range of tools in support of the development of a
  team-based software product.</li>

<li> Effectively communicate with peers and supervisors in a
  technical setting.</li>

</ol>
</p>


<HR>
<H2>
<A name="roles">Roles</A>
</H2>

<p>
Key roles in the capstone course are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Student Team</b>
      <br>
      Each project is to be completed by a team of students; in rare
      situations, that team may consist of a single student.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Client</b>
      <br>
      For most projects there will be a clearly identified Client
      who originally proposed the project or is a potential end user
      of the result; the client may or may not be a CS faculty member.
      The client typically serves as a primary point-of-contact in shaping
      the desired specification for the eventual product and may
      provide feedback on development prototypes.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Supervisor</b>
      <br>
      Each project will have a Supervisor who is a CS faculty
      member that oversees the team's progress on the project.  The
      Supervisor may or may not be the instructor-of-record for the
      course, and may be the same person as the Client, in cases where
      the Client is already a CS faculty member. The supervisor and instructor are jointly
      responsible for evaluating student teams.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Instructor</b>
      <br>
      The instructor-of-record for the course is responsible for the
      administration of the course, assignment of teams, scheduling of presentations, and
      record-keeping involving grades.
      </p> 
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
The Supervisor and the Instructor will work together in grading the
performance of the teams. A non-CS Client may be consulted, but has no
formal responsibilities in regard to evaluation.
</p>



<HR>
<H2>
<A name="projects">Project Selection</A>
</H2>

<p>
At the onset of CSCI&nbsp;4961 and CSCI&nbsp;5960, the instructor will circulate a
<a class="inactive" href="projects.html">list of potential projects</a> to consider. These projects are often suggested by
CS faculty members based on research endeavors or educational tools,
are based on requests coming from members of the broader SLU
community, or in some cases from external community groups. Students
will also be afforded an opportunity to suggest project ideas for
consideration. Projects should have an appropriate scope for a
culminating experience, having a richness in both aspects of design and use
of technology. <a href="general.html">Past examples of project descriptions will be provided</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the second week, individual students will be asked to
submit a <!--<a href="forms/preferences/">ranked list of preferences</a>--> ranked list of preferences for projects of interest, and
preferences regarding the composition of student teams. The
supervisors will make final determination of the teams and
their assignments to projects, while taking into consideration the
preferences submitted by students. Those assignments will be announced
by the end of the second week.
</p>

<p>
After project assignment, each student team must develop a <a href="projectPlan/index.html">formal
Project Plan</a> that outlines the scope of the project, and the timeline for
major deliverables for both Capstone&nbsp;I and Capstone&nbsp;II (for undergraduates)
or Capstone 5960 (for graduate students). This plan
must be approved and signed by both the Supervisor and Instructor no
later than the end of the third week of class to be considered prompt.
</p>


<HR>
<H2>
<a name="timeline">Project Timeline, Deliverables, Presentations</a>
</H2>

<p>
Each project is unique, and teams may adopt one of a variety of 
project management styles. However, all teams must adhere to the following
checkpoints and timeline (details of which follow).

		<p>
		<b>Project Plan</b>
		<br>
		Once your group is formed you should meet with your supervisor,
		client, and other group members to produce a rough roadmap
		for your capstone project. Your project plan should give a
		brief (1-2 page) executive summary of the project. This
		includes your client and their
		organization (if any), a description of the problem to be
		solved, background on existing technical work (if applicable),
		how your project intends to address the problem. You should
		also identify what development methodology you intend to
		pursue (agile, waterfall, etc.) and your team's structure or
		group member specialization (if any). 
		</p>
		<p>Most importantly, your project plan should identify four
		major deliverables (two for 5960) for your project. The content
		and scope of your deliverables will vary depending on your
		project. Make your best effort to create a rough draft with your
		group members, and then this will be revised with the input
		of your supervisor and instructor to create the final draft.
		</p>
		<p>This project plan becomes the "contract" between you and
		the CS department as to what constitutes acceptable progress
		in the capstone course. Of course no plan is a perfect 
		instrument, especially for a nine-month project, but failure
		to make adequate progress will put you in the position of
		having to explain why.</p>
		<p>You may find <a href="https://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/capstone/projectPlan/index.html">templates for your project plan here</a>.</p>

	</li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Deliverables</b>
      <br>
      Given the wide range of projects, there is no one-size-fits-all
      definition for the deliverables, but as part of the initial
      project plan, the students and Supervisor should outline four major
      stages of the project that are to be achieved by the four
      checkpoints in our timeline (middle of first semester, end of
      first semester, middle of second semester, end of second semester).
	</p><p>
      Graduate students taking 5960 will target two major deliverables at
      the middle of the semester and end of the semester. The example
      checkpoints below are commensurately compressed.
      </p>
      <p>
      For teams following a traditional waterfall model, 
      the deliverables will naturally follow a sequence of
      requirements specification and design documentation, an
      alpha software, then beta software, and finally
      verification and testing.
      </p>

	<p>
      For teams exploring research-driven questions, the
      deliverables might be papers that describe the work and results.
      </p>
      <p>
      For a more detailed example, for teams following an agile development
      process, example checkpoints are as follows:</p>

      <h2>Example Agile Development Deliverables</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>
	   <p>
	   <b>Deliverable #1 - Sprints 1 and 2 - Conceptualization and Instantiation</b>
	   <br>
		<ul>
		<li>A non-technical background document that describes the client, their organization, 
		the general problem they are facing, and a description of their expectations for the team.
		<li>A set of user stories that clearly define the different end users of the product
		and the various ways that those users interact with the software. 
		The team analyzes
		the expected features that are required for each user story and breaks down larger stories
		to where they could fit in a two-week sprint.
		<li>User stories are
		accompanied by an estimate of "business value" and "difficulty points." 
		<li>Each user story has a set of acceptance tests that define when the user
		story has a complete implementation.
		<li>User stories have been ordered into a tentative project backlog.
		There are at least (number of team members) times (number of sprints) backlog items.
		<li>The team has a functioning Git repository and a functional "Hello, world!"
		implementation in the desired technologies to serve as the basis for future iteration.
		</ul>
	   </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	   <p>
	   <b>Deliverable #2 - Sprints 3 and 4 - Rapid prototyping</b>
	   <br>
		<ul>
		<li>The team selects and implements those user stories with the highest business
		value and lowest difficulty, with the goal of creating a basic but functional
		first iteration of every major system component.
		<li>An automatic testing methodology (e.g. Gitlab CI/CD, or simply a test script)
		is established.
		<li>This functional first iteration is demoed to the client for feedback. 
		<li>The project backlog and existing user stories are refined (groomed, reviewed) to 
		remove items no longer relevant, add items in response to newly discovered needs,
		split items that are too large, combine items that are too small, 
		revise estimates of value and difficulty, and reassess the relative priority of
		each story.
		</ul>
	   </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	   <p>
	   <b>Deliverable #3 - Sprints 5 and 6 - Iteration</b>
	   <br>
		<ul>
		<li>The team selects and implements those user stories that contain
		advanced features or optional components, that fix bugs, or polish and
		streamline the user experience.
		<li>The release candidate is demoed to the client for feedback.
		<li>The project backlog is refined again.
		</ul>
	   </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	   <p>
	   <b>Deliverable #4 - Sprints 7 and 8 - Release, Deployment, and end-of-capstone migration</b>
	   <br>
		<ul>
		<li>The project is released to the whole group of potential end users for
		testing and feedback.
		<li>Post-release development focuses on stability, bug fixing, and user feedback, while
		also adding additional features as time permits. 
		<li>Suitable end-user documentation exists for each end user group, as well as
		documentation for future source code maintainers.
		</ul>
	   </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Example Waterfall Development Deliverables</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>
	    </p>
	    <b>Deliverable #1: Requirements Specification</b>
	    <br>
	    A writen document that clearly define the goals of the
	    final product in terms of functionality, user interface,
	    resource usage, and other such factors. This document
	    should include a project overview, any necessary
	    background knowledge, and an enumeration of formal
	    requirements specification for the eventual product
	    (e.g.,&nbsp;"Requirement&nbsp;7b").
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    <b>Deliverable #2: Design Document</b>
	    <br>
	    A writen document that describes a detailed design for achieving the
	    formal requirements. A design document should
	    include a description of the major components, their interfaces
	    and how they interact to form the whole. 
	    Figures should be included for clarity, such as a UML diagram of
	    the software design or an ER-diagram for a database.
	    This document should also contain a discussion of any
	    third-party technologies or software packages that will be
	    used in meeting the project goals. Teams should demonstrate 
	    software prototypes showing that
	    they have already evaluated and familiarized themselves with
	    key technologies and design choices.
	    Finally, this document must include a proposed time-line for the
	    remainder of the project life cycle, making sure to include
	    specific sub-goals for the development, implementation, and
	    testing phases of the project.
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    <b>Deliverable #3: Alpha Version</b>
	    <br>
	    The alpha version of the project is a preliminary
	    implementation that includes all
	    <em>major</em> functionality of the final product, yet may lack some
	    advanced features, have a less polished interface, and contain
	    some known bugs.
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    <b>Deliverable #4: Final Product</b>

      <b>Presentations</b>
      <br>
      The teams will make four presentations during the
      two-semester sequence, typically just after a recent deliverable
      was submitted.
      Each presentation will be scheduled with 20&nbsp;minutes
      for a formal presentation, followed by up to 10&nbsp;minutes of
      questions from faculty members in the audience.
      Teams should prepare <b>polished presentation materials</b> and
      for most projects include a <b>live demonstration</b> of the
      current state of a product.
      Teams should test the presentation and
      demonstrations in the designated classroom well in advance of the
      scheduled presentation.

      <b>Weekly Reports</b>
      <br>
      Each student is responsible for uploading a brief progress report to Git
      each week. Formally, each week's report is due at the start
      of class in the following week. For Capstone&nbsp;I and graduate students, the first
      report is due the Monday after your Git repository is created; Capstone&nbsp;II
      teams will make their first report on the second week of the
      semester.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each student should detail what they accomplished
      during the week,  what challenges were encountered, 
      and a plan for activities in the upcoming week.
      There should be one file per week for all group members,
      but each team member must write their own report.
      <em>Each team member must upload for herself or himself,
      so your activity is noted in the Git commit history.</em>
      The plain-text format is the easiest way to accomplish this
      and note that Gitlab allows for plain-text editing in the
      web user interface.
      </p>

      <p>

      Please inform the instructor in advance if you need to miss the
      class meeting; up to two absences are automatically excused, but any 
      unexcused absences beyond the first two will result in a grade penalty.

      <b>Team Self-Assessment</b>
      <br>
	For teams comprised of two or more students, each individual

	detailing his or her perception of the contributions of each team
	member. This assessment is due to the instructor 
	around finals each semester. This assessment exists to make the
	instructor aware of your group's team dynamic, as well as to
	understand any problems that may have arisen during the
	semester (though you are always welcome to come to the
	instructor prior to the team self-assessment). This assessment
	is strictly confidential and will only be shared with
	the instructor, your supervisor, or, in circumstances warranting
	it, with the computer science department chair(s).

<a name="repo">Repository for Project Artifacts</a>

<p>
<b>All teams will be required to use the department Git repositories for
all project artifacts (e.g., all deliverables, source
codes, presentation materials).</b> Both the instructor and supervisor
will be granted access to the repository from the beginning of the

<a name="graduate">Considerations for graduate students enrolled in CSCI 5960</a>
</H2>

<p>CSCI 5960 is considered a graduate level course, and is three credit hours
where both 4961 and 4962 are two credit hours. As such, the expecations
for your effort in this course are commensurately higher. Partly this is accounted
for in that you have one semester to go from project inception to completion
while undergraduate students have two. However, it is also reasonable to expect
graduate students to participate at a higher level and in different ways
than undergraduate students, such as serving as a project leader to a group
of undergraduate students, or tackling more difficult and complex aspects of
projects than your undergraduate peers.</p>

<p>The exact nature of your graduate experience in this course will vary
from project to project and even person to person. The CS department
faculty have final oversight over what constitutes an acceptable
experience to count for graduate credit.</p>

<HR>
<H2>
<a name="grading">Grading</a>
</H2>

<p>
Each semester of the capstone project is graded based
upon the performance during that semester. The evaluation of students'
artifacts and presentations will be made by a combination of the
Instructor and project Supervisor. The overall grade will be weighted
as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
      10% Weekly Reports (including Project Plan for Capstone&nbsp;I)
  </li>
  <li>
      20% Deliverable #1 (CSCI&nbsp;4961/5960) or Deliverable #3 (CSCI&nbsp;4962)
  </li>
  <li>
      15% Midterm Presentation
  </li>
  <li>
      40% Deliverable #2 (CSCI&nbsp;4961/5960) or Deliverable #4 (CSCI&nbsp;4962)
  </li>
  <li>
      15% Final Presentation
  </li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>
Letter grades will then be assigned based on the following formula.


<DL>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
      A.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
      A- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
      B+ or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of

      Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
      B- or better.

  <DD>
      Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
      C+ or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of
      C or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of
      C- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
      D or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
      F.
  </DD>
</DL>

Although team members will typically receive similar grades, in
some cases the Instructor and Supervisor may consider the
relative contribution of individual team members in assigning
individual grades.

<H2>
<a name="Attendance Policy">Attendance</a>
</H2>

<p>Successful students attend all or mostly all class sessions. This is true
in my experience <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187078">and has been demonstrated in large scale studies</a> as well.
In that study, even students who attended nine out of ten class periods had
measurably lower class performance than those who attended all classes. 
As stated above, having more than two unexcused absences will result in a penalty to your
class participation grade. You do not need to
get permission when you do miss class and you are free to use your two
automatically excused absences however you wish: you are an adult and have
the freedom to manage your time in whatever way you feel is most useful.
Job interviews, conferences, tests in other courses, etc. are all reasonable
cases for being absent.</p>

<p>Note that in-class assignments such as tests or quizes cannot be made
up outside of class without prior approval from the instructor. All such
activities will be listed course schedule with ample time to prepare
(i.e. there are no "pop quizes").</p>

<p>If you do miss class you should refer to the course schedule to see what was
missed and arrange to get course notes from another student. I am always happy
to answer questions but I do not repeat full class periods in office hours.</p>

<p><b>Required University Attendance Statement for Spring 2021</b></p>

The health and well-being of SLU’s students, staff, and faculty are critical concerns.  Accordingly, the following University policy statements on in-person class attendance are designed to preserve and advance the collective health and well-being of our institutional constituencies.

 <OL>
<LI>Students who exhibit any <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">potential COVID symptoms</a> (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) shall absent themselves from any in-person class attendance or in-person participation in any class-related activity until they have been evaluated by a qualified medical official.   Students should contact the <a href="https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-health/index.php">University Student Health Center</a> for immediate assistance.</LI>
<LI>Students who exhibit <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">potential COVID symptoms</a> (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) but who feel well enough to a) attend the course synchronously in an online class session or b) participate in asynchronous online class activities, are expected to do so.  Those who do not feel well enough to do so should absent themselves accordingly.</LI>
<LI>Students (whether exhibiting any of potential COVID symptoms or not, and regardless of how they feel) who are under either an isolation or quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official must absent themselves from all in-person course activity per the stipulations of the isolation or quarantine directive.  They are expected to participate in synchronous or asynchronous online class activities as they feel able to do so, or absent themselves accordingly.</LI>
<LI>Students are responsible for notifying each instructor of an absence as far in advance as possible; when advance notification is not possible, students are responsible for notifying each instructor as soon after the absence as possible.</LI>
<LI>As a temporary amendment to the current <a href="https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/attendance/">University Attendance Policy</a>, all absences due to illness or an isolation/quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official shall be considered “Authorized” absences (effective August 2020 through May 2021). </LI>
</OL>


<hr>
<H2>
<a name="COVID">COVID-19 Considerations for Spring 2021</a>
</H2>

<p>
<b>Notification of absences:</b> You do not need to notify the instructor
that you are missing a regular synchronous class meeting. Notify the
instructor as early as possible if you have a conflict with presentation times.
</p>

<p>
<b>Student Absences:</b> It is the responsibility of the student
to accommodate their absence. Make arrangements in advance with another
student to get a report of synchronous class activities and their notes
for the day. Our synchronous meetings will be recorded via Zoom,
but do not rely on such recordings: they do not record group breakout
sessions, the recording may fail, etc.</p>

<p>
Lecture content for this course is recorded and may be viewed at a later time.
</p>

<p><b>What happens if a student becomes ill:</b> As this is an online course, 
students who are mildly ill should continue to attend class and work on your
project when you are able.
Students with serious illnesses are excused from attending class and from
working on your project. Please email the professor if you are unable to work
on your project due to illness, and note this in your weekly update.</p>

<p>As capstone is a group project with immediate
and long-term deadlines, due dates will generally not be moved due to the 
illness of a student. Instead, faculty will take such circumstances into account
when evaluating the volume and quality of work submitted at each deliverable. 
However, the default assumption will be that a two-week illness of a single 
group member should not majorly impact the group's overall progress.</p>

<p>For
example, there are fourteen full weeks in a regular semester. A three
person group thus has 42 person-weeks of effort available to them. If all
three students in the group become severely ill to the point where they
individually cannot work for two weeks each, this represents a loss of
six person-weeks out of 42, or only one-seventh (14%) of the total effort 
available to the group. It would be reasonable for a group that becomes
severely ill to only implement six features instead of seven for the semester.
It would not be reasonable to significantly reduce the entire group's output,
such as making no effort on a deliverable entirely.
</p>

<p><b>What happens if the course instructor becomes ill:</b> As this is an entirely
online course the class will proceed as normal if the instructor is well enough to
meet. Otherwise a replacement faculty from the computer science department will
take over synchronous meeting times.</p>

<p>Depending on the timing of the illness some modification to the course schedule
and assignment deadlines may be required. If any modification takes place it will
always be announced and made in favor of the student- e.g. deadlines may be
extended, but never shortened. However, the capstone course is essentially a
group endeavor by all the faculty in the department- it is unlikely (under the
current circumstances) that enough faculty would be sick to warrant moving
our deliverable and presentation deadlines.</p>
