For this assignment, <b>you must work individually</b> in regard to
the design and implementation of your project.
</p>

<a name="goal"><h3>The Goal</h3></a>

<p>
Our goal for this problem is to create an image based upon underlying
data about the stars and constellations.  Our version of the project
is a variant of a <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2009/reid-starmap/">
nifty assignment</a> designed by
Karen Reid at the University of Toronto.


<p>
As an example, here is a
figure that shows a view of the night sky (click on the image
for a larger version):
<br>
<a href="stars.jpg"><img width=400 src="stars.jpg"></a>


<p>
Here is a second version of the image that also includes the display
of several major constellations.

<a name="format"><h3>Data File Format</h3></a>

<p>
The raw data for this assignment is provided in the form of two
different text files:
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="stars.txt">stars.txt</a>
      <br>
      The raw data for each individual star.
      <p>
      This file has one line for each star, with each line containing
      six pieces of information, separated by spaces.  Those six
      fields are respectively
      <ul>
	<li>
	    <b>x-coordinate</b><br>
	    This describes the horizontal position of the displayed
	    star on a scale from -1 to +1.
	</li>
	    <br>
	<li>
	    <b>y-coordinate</b><br>
	    This describes the vertical position of the displayed
	    star on a scale from -1 to +1.
	</li>
	    <br>
	<li>
	    <b>z-coordinate</b><br>
	    This describes the relative distance to the star on a scale
	    from -1 to +1. <em>For this assignment, we will not use
	    the z-coordinate data.</em>
	</li>
	    <br>
	<li>
	    <b>Henry Draper number</b><br>
	    For the purpose of cataloging astronomical data, each
	    star has been assigned a unqiue identification number,
	    known as its Henry Draper number.
	</li>
	    <br>
	<li>
	    <b>magnitude</b><br>
	    This is a floating-point number that descibes the
	    <a
	    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">apparent
	    magnitude</a> of a star.  It is a logarithmic scale with
	    smaller numbers denoting brighter stars (with Sirius
	    as the brightest star with a magnitude of -1.44).

	    We portray brightness in our image by drawing all
	    stars in white, but using bigger size for brighter stars. We
	    use the formula
	    <center>
	    <big><nobr>brightness = 15 * 10<sup><small>(mag/-2.512)</small></sup></nobr></big>
	    </center>
	</li>
	    <br>
	<li>
	    <b>Harvard Revised number</b><br>
	    This is another identification number for cataloguing
	    stars. <em>For this assignment, we will not use the
	    Harvard Revised numbers</em>.
	</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="constellations.txt">constellations.txt</a>
      <br>
      The constellation file has the following format. A single file
      has information about multiple constellations.
      Each individual constellation begins with a line containing its name.  The
      following line contains a single integer&nbsp;<em>n</em>, denoting the number of
      line segments to be drawn for the constellation.  Following that
      are <em>n</em> lines, one for each segment, containing a pair of
      Henry Draper identification numbers for the two stars to be
      connected by the segment.
      <p>
      For example, the data corresponding to the Big Dipper appears as
      follows:
<pre>Big Dipper
7
120315 116656
116656 112185
112185 106591
106591 103287
103287 95418
95418 95689
106591 95689</pre>

  </li>
</ul>

<a name="figure"><h3>The Matlab Figure</h3></a>


<p>
To get the basic star image in Matlab, we rely upon the
<a
href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatter.html"><tt>scatter</tt></a>
command.  We use the form
<tt>scatter(X,Y,S,C,'filled')</tt> where <tt>X</tt> is a vector of x-values,
<tt>Y</tt> is a vector of y-values, <tt>S</tt> is a corresponding
vector of scales (brightnesses for our application), and <tt>C</tt>
designates color.  For this assignment, we use <tt>'w'</tt> as the
color for all stars.  The final parameter <tt>'filled'</tt> designates
that the circles should be drawn as filled rather than the default outline.



<p>
To plot white stars against a black background, we need to configure
the basic figure window.  As with previous plots, it is also important
that we force the two axes to be drawn with an equivalent scale so
that the image is circular.  You may use the following function in
order to setup the figure window.
<pre>
function plotSky
   % This sets up a basic figure window for our plot of the sky.
   % It sets the background to black and sets the axes to be
   % equal but undisplayed.
   %
   % This function leaves the size as the default, but the user
   % can manually resize the figure window for a larger view.
   clf;
   hold off;               % start a new figure
   axis equal;             % ensure equal treatment of x and y axes
   axis off;               % do not display the actual axes
   set(gcf,'Color','k');   % set background color to black
   hold on;
</pre>


<p>
The constellation line segments are drawn based on the use of the
<tt>plot</tt> command for each individual line segment, using the x
and y coordinates for the two designated stars.  To get all segments
from the same constellation in the same color, but different
constellations in different colors, we use the following hack.  We
have a string <tt>'ymcrgb'</tt>  which contains six character codes
for the colors yellow, magenta, cyan, red, green, and blue.  For each
constellation, we pick one of those characters and use it when calling
plot to control the color.  Then when we move to a new constellation,
we advance one character in that control string (wrapping around to
the beginning if necessary).

<p>
Although we expect that in completing this assignment, you should
start by working on the function to plot the stars, and then the
function to plot the constellation, the final image will look nicer if
you plot the constellations first and the stars second, because then
the stars will be drawn on top of the constellation lines (making it
easier to see the stars that define the constellations).

<p>
As af final note, our image includes a legend to identify the names of
the constellations.  Providing that feature is considered <a
href="#extra">extra credit</a> for the sake of this assignment.

<a name="task"><h3>Your Task</h3></a>

<p>
To divide up the work more clearly, you are to write three different
functions, described as follows.

<ul>
  <li>
      <nobr><tt>stars = parseStarFile(filename)</tt></nobr>
      <br>
      This function reads the star data file and returns an appropriate
      matlab structure capable of being plotted.
      For example, you might use a two-dimensional
      table where you rely on a convention that column&nbsp;1 is the
      x-coordinate, column&nbsp;2 the y-coordinate, and so on.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <nobr><tt>plotStars(stars)</tt></nobr>
      <br>
      This function should take the data returned by
  <tt>parseStarFile</tt> and plot it on the current figure (presumably
      one that was already initialized with our <tt>plotSky</tt>
      function).

  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <nobr><tt>plotConstellations(constellationsFile, stars)</tt></nobr>
      <br>
      This function should plot all the constellations on the current
      figure.  Note that the function must be sent both the
      constellation structure and the stars data, because the
      constellation data makes references to Draper numbers of stars, and
      you will need to look up the x- and y-coordinates of the stars in
      order to be able to plot each line segment. It is probably best to
      parse the constellations file inside this function. 
  </li>
</ul>
