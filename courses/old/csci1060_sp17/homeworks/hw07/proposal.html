<b>Topic:</b>  Project Proposal

<br>


<p>
As a final assignment at the end of the semester, I would like you
(or you and a partner) to design and implement a project on a topic of
your choice (ideally, something related to your primary academic studies
or to personal interest of your own).


<p>
As a precursor to that assignment, you must submit a
formal project proposal. I will review the
proposals and either approve the suggested project or work with you
in revising the proposal. Your proposal should
provide the following information:
<ul>
  <li>
      Your name and the name of a partner (if any)
  </li>
  <li>
      A project title
  </li>
  <li>
      A summary of the problem to be solved.
  </li>
</ul>
The complete proposal should be a one or two page document.


<p>
If you are going to work with a partner, please submit a single
proposal together.  If you need assistance in finding a suitable
partner, please speak with me as soon as possible.
