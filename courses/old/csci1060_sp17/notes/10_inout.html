<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>
These notes provide a brief summary of commands that related to
presenting output or reading input with MATLAB.   Since output is
typically presented as a sequence of characters, we begin by
discussing the representation of and manipulation of character strings
in MATLAB.   Then we discuss the standard input and output when
a user interacts with a MATLAB program.   Similar techniques are used
for interacting with data in files.



<hr>

<h2><a name="string">Character Strings</a></h2>

<h3><a name="charvector">A vector of characters</a></h3>

<p>
A character string, such as <tt>'this is a test'</tt> is stored as
one-dimensional array of characters, with each individual character
encoded numerically (e.g., with ASCII).  This means that you can use
standard vector operations, such as indexing and slicing.

<pre>
greeting = 'how are you?';
length(greeting)            % returns 12
find(greeting == ' ')       % returns [4 8]
sort(greeting)              % returns '?aehooruwy'
</pre>

This means that we can also compose longer strings by concatenating
others.

<pre>
firstName = 'Edsger';
lastName = 'Dijkstra';
fullName = [ firstName ' ' lastName];   % notice the explicit space being concatenated
</pre>


<h3><a name="encoding">ASCII values</a></h3>


<p>
Each character is really stored as a binary number based on a fixed
encoding scheme.  The standard encoding for MATLAB is known as ASCII
(Unicode is another common encoding scheme that is an extension ASCII).

<p>
It is possible to compute the underlying numbers associated with
characters, as in the following
<pre>
uint8('A')                    % returns 65 (ASCII code for 'A')
uint8('a')                    % returns 97 (ASCII code for 'a')
unit8('hello')                % returns [104 101 108 108 111]
</pre>
or to compute the underlying characters, associated with numbers
<pre>
char(97)                      % returns 'a'
char([83 76 85])       % returns 'SLU'
</pre>

The implicit conversion of a string to a numerical vector happens as
well if you attempt to perform arithmetic on a string.
<pre>
greeting = 'hello';
greeting .* 3           % returns [312   303   324   324   333]
</pre>

A convenient use combining these techniques is to advance to a
different place in the alphabet using a syntax such as
<pre>
char('A' + 3);      % will be 'D'
</pre>


<h3><a name="casting">Numeric conversions</a></h3>

<p>
Separate from the issue of the underlying ASCII representation of
characters, is the distinction between a number such as <tt>123.45</tt> and the
three-character string <tt>'123.45'</tt> that we use to represent that
number.

<p>
MATLAB provides functions <tt>int2str</tt>, <tt>num2str</tt>, and
<tt>str2num</tt> to do conversions between the numbers and their
string representations.

<p>
As named, <b><tt>int2str</tt></b> converts from an
integer to the corresponding string representation.
<pre>
s = int2str(123);    % s will be string '123'
</pre>
This can be very useful in conjunction with string concatenation.
<pre>
low = 1;
high = 10;
prompt = [ 'Pick a number from ', int2str(low), ' to ', int2str(high) ];
</pre>

<p>
The <b>num2str</b> function is similar, but it can convert 
floating-point numbers to strings.  By default, it uses up to four
digits after the decimal point.  The maximum number to use can be
controlled by sending a second parameter.
<pre>
num2str(pi);        % seems to return '3.1416'
num2str(pi,7);      % returns '3.141593'
</pre>

<p>
The <b>str2num</b> function converts in the opposite direction.  If
you send it a character string that corresponds to the representation
of a numeric value, it returns the numeric value.



<h3><a name="sprintf">General string formatting with <tt>sprintf</tt></a></h3>

<p>
A far more general tool for formating strings is the <tt>sprintf</tt>
function.  It allows you to specify the number of digits to use when
display data, as well as whether it should be left or right justified.

<p>
For example, we can use <tt>sprintf</tt> to create our earlier prompt
as
<pre>
prompt = sprintf('Pick a number from %d to %d.', low, high);
</pre>
Each <tt>%d</tt> is a place holder for a number that will be expressed
later as arguments (namely <tt>low</tt> and <tt>high</tt> in this example).

<p>As an aside, the function<tt>fprintf</tt> operates much like <tt>sprintf</tt> but prints
output directly to the command window rather than storing the result
in a variable. Hence, the commands
<pre>
prompt = sprintf('Pick a number from %d to %d.', low, high);
disp(prompt);
</pre>
and the command
<pre>
fprintf('Pick a number from %d to %d.\n', low, high);
</pre>
are equivalent. Note the <tt>\n</tt> at the end of the second command.
This tells MATLAB to print a new line at that point. Failing to include
this newline marker will generate poorly formatted output. This is discussed
further below.

<p>
Commonly used place holders include

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%d</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	integer displayed in base 10 (decimal) notation
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%f</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	floating-point value displayed as 1234.567
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%e</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	floating-point value displayed with exponential notation
	(e.g., 1.234567e+03)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%g</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	more compact of <tt>%e</tt> and <tt>%f</tt>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%s</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	character string
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>
Additional details about the desired format can be specified using a
syntax such as the following
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%8d</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	pad the number with leading spaces to use at least 8 columns
	(i.e., right-justified)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%08d</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	pad the number with leading zeros to use at least 8 columns
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%-8d</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	pad the number with trailing spaces to use at least 8 columns
	(i.e., left-justified)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%8f</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	print the number using at least 8 columns (padding with spaces
	if necessary).  Note that the decimal point itself is one of
	those 8 columns, and this form does not make explicitly how
	many numbers are displayed after the decimal point.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%08f</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	same as previous, but padding with zeros rather than spaces.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%8.3f</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	print the number using at least 8 columns (padding with spaces
	if necessary), and precisely 3 digits trailing the decimal point.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%.3f</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	print the number using precisely 3 digits trailing the decimal
	point.  The overall width of the number will depend upon the
	magnitude that comes before the decimal place.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%8s</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	String printed with leading spaces if necessary so as to use
	at least 8 columns (i.e., right-justified)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	<tt>%-8s</tt>
    </td>
    <td>
	String printed with trailing spaces if necessary so as to use
	at least 8 columns (i.e., left-justified)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Please note that for all of the above, the overall width specifier is
only a <em>minimum</em> number of columns.  MATLAB may use more than
that many columns if the value requires as such.


<p>
<b>Vectorized operations.</b>
<br>
The arguments to a sprintf command can be specified individually or
as a vector or array.  Also, if more elements are provided then are
required by the formatting string, it repeats the string for each
consecutive group of specified values.  This can be used to produce a formatted string for all
entries of a vector or even all columns of an array.
<pre>
matlab&gt; disp(sprintf('%5d', 2 .^ (1:8)));
    2    4    8   16   32   64  128  256
matlab&gt; temp = [1:8;  2.^(1:8)];
matlab&gt; disp(sprintf('Two to the power of %d is %5d\n', temp));
Two to the power of 1 is     2
Two to the power of 2 is     4
Two to the power of 3 is     8
Two to the power of 4 is    16
Two to the power of 5 is    32
Two to the power of 6 is    64
Two to the power of 7 is   128
Two to the power of 8 is   256
</pre>

<p>
For a more complete description of the formatting syntax, see the <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/f2-47856.html&http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/f2-47856.html#bq0he44-1">official
MATLAB documentation</a>. These are used for <tt>sprintf</tt> as well
as <tt>fprintf</tt>.



<h3><a name="sscanf">General string parsing with <tt>sscanf</tt></a></h3>

The <tt>sprintf</tt> command is used to combine pieces of data into a
single formatted string.   There are times where we have a single
string that we wish to interpret as a sequence of individual data
values.  For example, we might have the string
<nobr><tt>raw = '2009 01 30 8000.86'</tt></nobr> that was entered by a user
or read from a file, and we expect that it is formatted to describe a
year, month, date, and closing price for the stock market.  We can
parse that string by using the syntax
<pre>
sscanf(raw, '%d %d %d %f')
</pre>
which returns an array of length four containing the numeric data.
<tt>sscanf</tt> is typically used to read either all numeric values or
all string values.  Read the documentation for a discussion of what
happens if you read both numbers and strings.



<hr>

<h2><a name="user">User I/O</a></h2>


In the preceding section, we discussed MATLAB's treatment of character
strings and the conversions back and forth between other data types
and strings.  In this section, we focus more carefully on techniques
for interacting with the user of a program.


<h3><a name="userTiming">Controlling Timing</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
      <b><tt>pause</tt></b>
      <br>
      With a parameter, as in <tt>pause(1.5)</tt> this pauses a
      specific amount of time, measured in seconds.

      <p>
      Without a
      parameter, as in <tt>pause()</tt>, this pauses the script until
      the user presses the return key (this form is available in
      MATLAB but not octave).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="userOutput">Displaying Output</a></h3>

Here are three ways to display data to the user.

<ul>
  <li>
      <b><tt>expression</tt></b>
      <br>
      Will display the variable name and the value using MATLAB's
      default format.  For example, this is what happens if you issue
      the command
      <pre>
      pi
      </pre>
      without a semicolon ending the expression.
      
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
      <b><tt>disp(expression)</tt></b>
      <br>
      Displays the expression (automatically converted to a string
      representation) and then a single newline character.  In this
      case, only the value of the expression is displayed, not the
      variable name.  For example
      <pre>
      disp(pi);
      </pre>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
      <b><tt>fprintf(formatstring, parameters)</tt></b>
      <br>
      Similar to <tt>sprintf</tt> but instead of return the string as
      a result, it automatically prints it to the user's console. This
      is almost synonymous with <nobr><tt>disp(sprintf(formatstring,
      parameters))</tt></nobr>, except that the use of <tt>disp</tt>
      causes a final newline character to be printed, while direct use
      of <tt>fprintf</tt> does not.   If desired, a newline character
      can be explicitly embedded as part of the format string using
      the <tt>\n</tt> control sequence.  For example
      <pre>
      fprintf('The value of pi is %.6f.\n', pi);
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="userInput">Receiving Input</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
      <b><tt>input(prompt)</tt></b>
      <br>
      This presents the string prompt to the user and then waits for
      one line of input. That input is evaluated as if
      it were typed at the MATLAB command prompt.  It can be as simple
      as a number (e.g., <tt>23</tt>), or a complicated expression
      including function calls and variables from the workspace (e.g.,
      <tt>sin(pi/3)</tt>). The result of the expression is returned.

      <p>
      <b>Although many authors use this form, we wish to discourage
      its use.</b>  The problem is that a user can easily wreak havoc
      on a program depending on what they type.  Because their
      expression is evaluated directly, they can make assignments to
      variables (e.g., by typing <tt>x = 5</tt>), and any syntax
      errors that result will crash the program.  We prefer the
      following style.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
      <b><tt>input(prompt, 's')</tt></b>
      <br>
      With the <tt>'s'</tt> designation as the second parameter, this
      prompts the user to enter a line and returns the precise
      characters that they typed as a character string.   That string
      is not directly evaluated as a MATLAB expression.  Once we have
      the string, if we wish to interpret it as some other set of
      values, we can make use of commands like <tt>str2num</tt> or
      <tt>sscanf</tt> to parse the user's response.
      
  </li>
</ul>
