<p>
We will be using the following file in lecture: <a href="canon.txt" download>canon.txt</a>.
This file contains the notes of Pachelbel's Canon represented in an unusual format. Each
row is a separate note to be played: the first column is the note's frequency, the
second column is the note's starting time (in seconds), and the third column is the note's 
duration. </a>

<p>
Wav files:
<ul>
<li><a href="Beatles.wav">Beatles.wav</a> (backmasking at 2:25 through 2:37)
<li><a href="instr_flute.wav">instr_flute.wav</a>
<li><a href="instr_piano.wav">instr_piano.wav</a>
</ul>
</p>

<!--
We are distributing various supporting files related to these topics:
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="files/wav">sample WAV files</a>
      <br>
      Includes a Beatles song with backmasking (2:25 through 2:37 of
      the song), as well as Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven
      (controversial for claim of backmasking from 4:19 through 4:42).
      <p>
      There are also two sample files providing instrument samples for
      a single note (piano, and violin).
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="files/midi">sample MIDI files</a>
      <br>
      A simple one (coldplay.mid) is a "format&nbsp;0" midi file, having a
      single track.
      <p>
      A more complex one (LetItBe.mid) is a "format&nbsp;1" having
      multiple, synchronous tracks.
      <p>
      We will not consider the more complex "format&nbsp;2" files,
      that use asynchronious tracks.

<h3>MATLAB support for sound</h3>

Digitized sounds can be manipulated as a one-dimensional array of
numbers per channel.  We will rely on MATLAB's builtin support

<ul>
  <li>
      <a
  href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/audioread.html&http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/audioread.html">audioread</a>
      <br>
      Sample usage:
      <pre>
      [samples freq bitsPerSample aux] = audioread(filename)
      </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a
  href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/audiowrite.html&http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/audiowrite.html">audiowrite</a>
      <br>
      Sample usages:
      <pre>
      audiowrite(samples, filename)
      audiowrite(samples, freq, filename)
      audiowrite(samples, freq, bitsPerSample, filename)
      </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a
  href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/audioplay.html&http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/audioplay.html">audioplay</a>
      <br>
      Sample usages:
      <pre>
      audioplay(samples, freq)
      audioplay(samples, freq, 'async')    %  call returns even while sound is still playing
      audioplay(samples, freq, 'sync')     %  call waits until sound is complete before returning
      </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Plotting audio waves</h3>

A simple function for plotting stereo sound

<pre>
function plotStereo(y, fs)
  subplot(2,1,1);
  x = linspace(0, length(y)/fs, length(y));
  plot(x,y(:,1), 'b');      % plot in blue
  ylabel('Left');
  xlabel('seconds');
  axis([0 length(y)/fs -1 1]);
  grid on;
  subplot(2,1,2);
  plot(x,y(:,2), 'r');       % plot in red
  ylabel('Right');
  xlabel('seconds');
  axis([0 length(y)/fs -1 1]);
  grid on;
</pre>

<h3>Synthesizing sounds</h3>

<p>
We examined how to develop pure tones of a given frequency as a cosine
wave, how to create other waves such as square or sawtooth waves, and how to
combine different harmonics of a note to create a more realistic sounding
instrument.
We then examined
high-level approaches to representing songs as a series of notes, or
as a composition of overlayed notes.


<!--
<p>
All of our full source code is available at the link near the top of
this page.  But a highlight of the signatures we used are as follows.

<ul>
  <li>
<pre>function hz = midiFreq(note)
    % Returns the frequency for a given note on midi scale.
    % For example, MIDI 60 is middle C (261.626HZ)</pre>
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
<pre>function Y = pureTone(freq, duration, amplitude, fs)
    % Generates a cosine wave representing a pure tone.
    % freq specifies the audio frequency (in Hertz)
    % duration specifies the length of the tone (in seconds)
    % amplitude of sound (with 127 being the loudest)
    % fs desginates the playback frequency (samples per second)
    %    (fs is 8000 by default)</pre>
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
<pre>function Y = ramp(Y, leadTime, trailTime, fs)
    % linear ramps the given signal.
    % Y can be a row vector or column vector.
    % leadTime (in seconds) will be ramped from zero to full attentuation
    % trailTime (in seconds) will be ramped from full attentuation to zero
    % fs is sample rate</pre>
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
<pre>function Y = buildNote(freq, duration, amplitude, fs, instr)
    % Produces waveform for single note.
    % freq specifies the audio frequency (in Hertz)
    % duration specifies the length of the tone (in seconds)
    % amplitude of sound (with 127 being the loudest)
    % fs desginates the playback frequency (samples per second)
    % instr is a waveform for the instrument (at 260HZ and 44100fs)
    %   (if not given, pureTone will be formed)</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MIDI format</h3>


Here are some external links to information about MIDI format:
<br>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m15049/latest">http://cnx.org/content/m15049/latest</a>
<br>
<a href="http://faydoc.tripod.com/formats/mid.htm">http://faydoc.tripod.com/formats/mid.htm</a>


<p>
Our goal is to write a MATLAB program that can process authentic midi
files and produce a sound wave for the music (at least a simplified
one that ignores changes in instruments).


<p>
This lead to the following additional functionality.
<ul>
  <li>
<pre>
function song = parseMidi(filename)
    % returns a song structure with the following fields
    %  format   (0=single track, 1=multiple syncronized tracks, 2=multiple asyncronous)
    %  ticksPerQuarter   tick units per quarter note
    %  tracks   cell array of individual tracks, each of which is an array
    %           of "event" structures.
    %
    % Each event structure has the following fields
    %   delta     the lead time (measured in ticks) between preceding event and this
    %   status    a code for the event type (e.g., 8 = NoteOff, 9 = NoteOn)
    %   channel   what channel should the note be played on
    %   note      the midi number for the note
    %   amplitude the midi number for the note
</pre>
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
<pre>
function Y = composeMidiSong(song, tempo, fs)
    % Create a wave for the given song structure.
    % tempo is measured in beats per second
    %     (assume that a quarter note is one beat)
    % fs is the desired sample rate for the waveform

</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
