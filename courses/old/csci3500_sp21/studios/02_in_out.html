<p>Linux stream redirection is a powerful feature where program inputs and
outputs can be hooked together seamlessly by the system to build compound
commands. In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> functions to
read input and write output
  <li>Redirect program inputs and outputs
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>One basic Linux tool you might know about is a program called
<code>cat</code>. This program con<i>cat</i>enates (appends) any 
provided input to standard output. It's a useful way to print text
files to the terminal, or to write bits of data into a text file.</p>

<p>Go ahead and type the command "<code>cat</code>" and hit enter. Then,
write a few lines of text to the console (and hit enter after each line). 
As the answer to this exercise, describe what happens.</p>

<p>You can type CTRL-D on a blank line in order to quit <code>cat</code>.
Typing CTRL-D sends a special "end of file" character to the terminal.</p>  

<p><li>The original purpose of <code>cat</code> is to print text files to
the console. Find your favorite text file if you'd like, or you can download
one of mine with the <code>wget</code> command:</p>

<p><code>wget http://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/csci3500/studios/mars.txt --no-check-certificate</code></p>

<p>In the last exercise, the <code>cat</code> program got its data from
standard input (i.e. the keyboard). One neat feature of Linux is that it allows
us to <i>redirect</i> streams like standard input and standard output. Using
your text file, redirect standard input with the '<code>&lt;</code>'
character as such:</p>

<p><code>cat &lt; mars.txt</code></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, describe what happens.</p>

<p><li>We can also redirect output. This time, redirect standard output with
the '<code>&gt;</code>' character into a new text file. Use the syntax:</p>

<p><code>cat &gt; new.txt</code></p>

<p>Enter a few lines of text. Open up your text file to see the results.
Remember that you can quit <code>cat</code> with CTRL-D. </p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, describe what happens.</p>

<p><li>One last useful tip. Repeat the last exercise, but instead of using
a single greater-than symbol, use two. (That is, use '<code>&gt;&gt;</code>'
instead of '<code>&gt;</code>'). This <i>appends</i> your input to the end
of the file, rather than overwriting the start of the file.</p>

<p>Leave this answer blank.</p>

<p><li>Now we'll write a short program that mimics the behavior of
<code>cat</code>. Start by creating a new file called <code>copy.c</code>
and fill it out with the framework for an empty program (see Studio 01 if
you'd like to see that framework again).</p>

<p>Look at the manual pages for the system calls <code>read()</code> and
<code>write()</code>, and look at your code from Studio 01 to see how you
used <code>write()</code>. What header file do you need to include to use
these system calls?</p>

<p><li>Both functions require a <i>buffer</i> (a fixed region of memory) to
operate. At the top of your program, define a preprocessor constant with the
size of your buffer as such:</p>

<p><code>#define bufferSize 200</code></p>

<p>Then allocate an array of characters to be your buffer:</p>

<p><code>char buffer[ bufferSize ];</code></p>

<p>Leave this answer blank.</p>

<p><li>The behavior of <code>cat</code> is to read input forever until it
encounters an end of file character. Look up the documentation for the
<code>read()</code> system call. What is the return value <b><i>type</i></b>
for <code>read()</code>? What is the specific return value that indicates
the end of a file?

<p><li>Your last job is to translate the following algorithm into C code.
Inside an infinite loop:
<ol>
<li>Read from standard input (<code>STDIN_FILENO</code>) into the buffer.
<li>If the return value indicates end of file, then "<code>break;</code>" out of the loop.
<li>Write the contents of the buffer to standard output (<code>STDOUT_FILENO</code>). Be
careful to use the return value from <code>read()</code> so as not to write more than was read.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
When you are satisfied with your code, compile it and test it in all the ways
we tested <code>cat</code> above. Does your program's behavior match? Note that
you will need to invoke your program with "<code>./</code>", as in:
</p>
<p><code>./copy &lt; mars.txt</code></p>

<p><li>Do you think that modifying <code>bufferSize</code> will affect
the correctness of your program? What if <code>bufferSize</code> is very
small, or even equal to one? Try a few different values for 
<code>bufferSize</code> and record the results.</p>

<p><li>What do you think the tradeoff is between having a small
<code>bufferSize</code> versus having a large one?</p>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<p><li>You can write the same program on top of the C standard library as well!
Instead of using <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>, try using the
libc functions <code>fgets()</code> and <code>fprintf()</code>.</p>

</ol>
