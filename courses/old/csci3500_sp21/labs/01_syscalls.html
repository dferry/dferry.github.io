<p>System calls are the fundamental API provided by an operating system
to application programs. For example, the <code>read()</code> and
<code>write()</code> system calls are the basic mechanisms for doing file
input and output in Linux. All other file I/O routines, such as C++'s stream
operators (<code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>) or Python's
file methods (<code>file.read()</code> and <code>file.write()</code>)
are built upon these C-interface system calls.</p>

<p>To make sure we never take these high-level interfaces for granted, we're 
going to work with Linux's system calls directly! We will use
Linux's file manipulation system calls to write a program that compresses
and decompresses files.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>, <code>read()</code>,
and <code>write()</code> system calls to do file I/O
  <li>Implement a simple lossless data compression method called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding"> run-length encoding</a>.
  <li>Perform proper Linux/Unix style error checking on all functions that may
return an error
</ol>

<p><h3>Lab Format</h3></p>
<p>This assignment can be completed in groups of three, though you may work
by yourself or in a group of two if you wish.</p>


<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Program name</h3></p>
<p><code>rle</code> - compress or decompress a file with run-length encoding</p>

<p><h3>Usage</h3></p>
<p><code>rle &lt;input file&gt; &lt;output file&gt; &lt;compression length&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>input file</code>: the file to compress/decompress</p>
<p><code>output file</code>: the result of the operation</p>
<p><code>compression length</code>: the base size of candidate runs
<p><code>mode</code>: specifies whether to compress or decompress- if mode=0, then compress the input file, if mode=1 then decompress the input file</p>


<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p><code>rle</code> implements run-length encoding for the compression of files.
You must use the <code>read()</code> and
<code>write()</code> system calls (documented at <code>man 2 read</code> and
<code>man 2 write</code>, respectively) to read the input file and write to
the output file. Additionally, your program should only output runs of
up to length 255, this is so the run-length specifier is guaranteed to
always be one byte. </p>

<p>Run-length encoding is a compression technique that identifies "runs" of
repeated characters and represents these compactly. The length of each run
is counted, and the base is stored along with the number of repetitions
of that basis. For example, the string <code>AAABBBBBB</code> consists of
nine bytes, but it could be instead represented as <code>3A6B</code>, where
"A" and "B" are the basis of each run and the numbers give how many times
each base is repeated.</p>

<p>The base does not need to be length-1, and this is what the third program
parameter above specifies. For example,
the string <code>ABABABCDCDCDCD</code> compresses very poorly with length-1
encoding to <code>1A1B1A1B1A1B1C1D1C1D1C1D1C1D</code>, which is an expansion
from 14 bytes to 28 bytes. However, if we allow our base to be length-2 then
we can represent the above as <code>3AB4CD</code>, which is a reduction from
14 bytes to 6 bytes.</p>

<p>Each run should be a maximum of 255 repetitions. This is so the run-length
specifier can always be represented as a single byte (recall that an 8-bit
unsigned integer can store values from 0-255). For example, if you had the
character "A" stored 300 times in a row, then with a length-1 encoding
your program should produce "255A45A" rather than "300A".</p>

<p>One can imagine many versions of RLE that are optimizations of the above
principle. For this assignment I ask you to implement the simplest algorithm
that mimics the behavior given above. In particular, given a run-length
parameter K, then starting at the beginning of the input file:</p>

<ol>
<li> Read in the next K bytes of the file, and set a counter to one
<li> Scan the next K bytes of the file, if these bytes equal the first K bytes
then increment the counter by one
<li> Repeat the previous step until a new pattern is found
<li> Output the value of the counter along with the original pattern
<li> Reset the counter to one and repeat the above process for the new pattern
</ol>

<p>Decompressing files is much easier:</p>

<ol>
<li> Read in the first byte of the file as an integer N
<li> Read in the next K bytes of the file as a length-K base pattern
<li> Output that pattern N times
<li> Repeat the above process
</ol>

<p><code>rle</code> detects the following errors and quits gracefully:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Not enough / too many command line arguments (and prints a usage statement)
<li>Compression length less than 1
<li>A mode value other than 0 or 1 (hint: use <code>strtol()</code>)
<li>Input file does not exist or is otherwise not openable
<li>Any errors returned from <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>,
<code>read()</code>, or <code>write()</code> - use the
function <code>perror()</code> to print useful error messages
</ul></p>

<p>Upon encountering any error, print a useful message and <code>exit()</code>
with a negative status code.</p>

<p>If no error is encountered then the program should not produce any output
to standard output, and should only modify the output file.</p>

</ul></p>

<p>You can download these files to your local machine with the
<code>wget</code> program from the Linux command line. See
<code>man wget</code> for details. Unfortunately as of this writing
the SLU CS webserver does not have a correct set of certificates
installed, so your command will have to use an optional parameter
to ignore this. Your command will look something like:</p>

<p><code> wget http://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/csci3500/labs/lab1/test1 --no-check-certificate</code></p>

<p><h3>Sample Outputs</h3></p>

<p>You can use the <code>xxd</code> program to inspect your program output.
Many text editors do not handle non-printable characters gracefully, but
<code>xxd</code> prints the underlying binary data in hexadecimal. For example,
the <code>test1</code> test case contains the sequence 
<code>AAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</code> followed by a new-line
character. The <code>xxd</code> program generates the following output:

<pre>
[dferry@hopper lab1]$xxd test1
0000000: 4141 4141 4242 4242 4242 4242 4343 4343  AAAABBBBBBBBCCCC
0000010: 4343 4343 4343 4343 4141 4141 4141 4141  CCCCCCCCAAAAAAAA
0000020: 4141 4141 4141 4141 0a                   AAAAAAAA.
</pre>

<p>The left column gives the location of the displayed data within the file.
The middle section displays sixteen bytes of hexadecimal data (remember that
one hex number describes four bits, so two hex digits describes one byte).
The right section displays the printable-text equivalent of the hexadecimal
data. Looking from left to right we see byte 0x41 repeated four times
(ASCII code for 'A'), then 0x42 repeated eight times (for 'B'), then
0x43 repeated twelve times (for 'C') and then 0x41 repeated sixteen
times (for 'A' again). The last byte in the file, 0x0a, is the New Line
character: since this isn't a printable character, it is represnted with a
period in the right hand side display.</p>

<p>Thus, compressing the first file acording to the specifications above gives
the following outputs:</p>

<pre>
[dferry@hopper lab1]$./rle test1 compressed 1 0
[dferry@hopper lab1]$xxd compressed
0000000: 0441 0842 0c43 1041 010a                 .A.B.C.A..
</pre>

<p>Notice we have the value 4 followed by the code for 'A', then the value 8
followed by the code for 'B', then the value 12 (hexadecimal code 0x0c) 
followed by the code for 'C', and the value 16 followed by the code for 'A'
again. Continuing:</p>

<pre>
[dferry@hopper lab1]$./rle test1 compressed 2 0
[dferry@hopper lab1]$xxd compressed
0000000: 0241 4104 4242 0643 4308 4141 010a       .AA.BB.CC.AA..
</pre>

<pre>
[dferry@hopper lab1]$./rle test1 compressed 4 0
[dferry@hopper lab1]$xxd compressed
0000000: 0141 4141 4102 4242 4242 0343 4343 4304  .AAAA.BBBB.CCCC.
0000010: 4141 4141 010a                           AAAA..
</pre>

<pre>
[dferry@hopper lab1]$./rle test2 compressed 1 0

0000020: 0143 0441 010a                           .C.A..

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>
<p><ol>
<li>Make sure you master the basics of the <code>read()</code> and
<code>write</code> system calls with studios 1 and 2 before attempting
this lab assignment.
<li>Read the manual page for <code>open()</code> carefully. The output
file may not exist, or if it does exist you should overwrite it starting
at the beginning. Thus, you should specify the O_CREAT and O_TRUNC flags, and
because you specify O_CREAT you should also specify (at a minimum) the
S_IRUSR and S_IWUSR file permissions.
<li>Four test files are provided for you to experiment with. Each of them
test a different aspect of your program- make sure your program works with
all of them! If you compress and then decompress the same file you should
have identical contents before and after. Feel free to make your own
test files as well.
<li>Look at the man pages for all the functions you use. All of them will
give the possible return values as well as how errors are specified. 
<li>You can use the <code>diff</code> program to compare before/after files and it highlight any
differences. This is an easy way to detect whether or not a decrypted file
is identical to the original source, especially when the files are too large
to inspect visually!
<li>Use can use the <code>ls -l</code> command to see how many bytes are
in each file.
<li>The <code>read()</code> system call returns how many bytes it has read.
This is useful info- you might ask the <code>read()</code> function to read
in four bytes, but it might not be able to, such as if you're at the end
of a file. This also tells you when there is no more input to be read: you can 
keep reading until <code>read()</code> returns a 0 (end of file) or -1 (error).

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the name(s) of the people who
worked together on this lab.</p>

<p><li>This compression technique works well in some cases, and poorly in
others. Give an example of each.</p>

<p><li>The <i>compression ratio</i> can be computed as (size before compression)/(size after compression).
For example if the original file size is 20,000 bytes and the compressed size is
15,000 bytes then the compression ratio is 1.33. There are three files above of size
one million bytes each: 1mil_random, 1mil_weak_bias, and 1mil_strong_bias. Each of
these files contains the numbers 0-4 in random order, but the random file contains all numbers distrbuted
evenly, while the weak and strong bias files shift the distribution so that the lower number
values occur more often. For example, zero occurs about 20% of the time in the random
file, about 75% of the time in the weak bias file, and about 90% of the time in the
strong bias file.</p>

<p>Which file do you think will compress best? Compute the compression ratio for each file with a compression length of one.</p>

<p><li>The Bash shell includes the nifty command <code>time</code>, which records how
long a command runs. Record how long it takes to compress the file <code>test4</code>.
The syntax in this case is "<code>time ./rle test4 output 1 0</code>". 
This will report three measurements: real, user,
and sys. How long does your program take to run in real time? 

<p><li>Try the above command again but with a compression length of ten, how
long does your program take now? Which operations happen more or less
frequently now? Formulate a hypothesis as to the difference.</p>

<p><li>Indicate which, if any, extra credit exercises have you have attempted.</p>
</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>3% Extra Credit</b>: Download the slu_logo.bmp file above,
this is an uncompressed image file. Compress the file, then uncompress it. 
Verify that you can still open the
image in a photo viewer and that it is not distorted.</p>

<p>The compression algorithm you have implemented
is a form of lossless compression, meaning that the entire uncompressed
file can be reconstructed and no data is lost. This approach works well
for highly structured data with lots of repitition. This can happen
naturally in a case like slu_logo.bmp, where the whole image has just a
few colors and lots of large same-color regions. Compute the compression
ratio of your algorithm with slu_logo.bmp. Then, open the file in a
photo editor (such as Microsoft Paint, Photoshop, or GIMP) and save it
as a .png file (lossless compression) and a .jpg file (lossy compression).
Compute the compression ratio for each method.</p> 

<p><li><b>2% Extra Credit</b>: As it turns out, lossy compression can be far
more effective in some situations than lossless compression. Compression algorithm
researchers are very skilled at removing data that is virtually imperceptible.
Download <a href="lab1/uncompressed.bmp">this file</a> and compute the
compression ratio using your algorithm. Then, use a standard photo editor
from before to generate a losslessly compressed .png file and a lossily compressed 
.jpg file and compute their compression ratios. Inspect the files carefully,
are you able to discern a difference between the three?</p>
