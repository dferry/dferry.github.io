Iterative Solvers

<p>
Our previous programs for analyzing the gambler problem were based on
what is called a "Monte Carlo" simulation.   To estimate quantities
such as the probability of success, the expected number of bets made,
and the percentage of time with each bankroll, we performed
independent trials of the random experiment.  The more trials that we
performed, the more we expect our observed statistics to approach the
theoretical bounds.  But the problem with a Monte Carlo technique is
that each trial takes time and we may need to do an inordinate number
of trials in order to get a decent approximation.

<p> We will explore a new algorithmic approach that can be used for
computing values for the gambler problem more efficiently.  We develop
an <em>iterative solver</em> that works by starting with an initial
guess of the results, and then iteratively computing <em>successive
approximations</em> based on our understanding of the model.
In this case of the gambler's problem, 
let the notation <em>win(goal, start, p)</em>
represent the overall chance of success given the <em>goal</em>, the <em>start</em>
bankroll, and the fixed probability&nbsp;<em>p</em>.   Given a fixed
goal and p value, we want to compute the probability of success for
each starting bankroll from 0 to goal.  We know the following about
the theoretical value of this expression.

<p>
win(goal, start, p) = 
<ul>
  <li><b>0</b> (when start == 0)<br>
      The gambler has no chance of winning.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li><b>1</b> (when start == goal)<br>
      The gambler succeeds without any bets.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li><nobr><b>(1-p) * win(goal, start-1, p) + p * win(goal, start+1, p)</b></nobr> otherwise<br>
      If the gambler were to lose the first bet (occurs with
      probability 1-p), it is like he is
      starting over with an initial bankroll of one less.  If he wins
      the first bet (as happens with probability p), it is as if he
      starts over with an initial bankroll of one more.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
This formula provides enough information for us to compute the answers
using an interative solver.   We make an initial guess (perhaps a
linear function from 0 to 1).  Then we repeatedly compute a better
guess based on applying the above formula relative to the previous
guess.  Each iteration should improve our estimates, eventually
converging near the theoretical values.  We will repeat this process
until performing an iteration in which the new estimates vary from the
old estimates by at most some desired error tolerance.


<p>
Before exploring code for the iterative solution to the gambler's
problem, we will look at a simpler problem that can be solved with
this approach:  calculating the square root of a number.  A common algorithm, known as
<em>Newton's Method</em>, is based on computing successive
approximations to the square root. To compute the square root of
<em>n</em>, we make an initial guess (e.g.,
1).  Once we have a guess, it is easy to test whether the guess is the
correct square root.  If it were the square root, we'd have that
<em>guess</em> and <em>n/guess</em> would be equal.  If they are not
equal (or not within a specified error tolerance of equal), we can
compute a new approximation which is the average of
<em>guess</em> and <em>n/guess</em>.



<!--<p>
Our own implementation of the approach is given in
<a href="mySqrt.m">mySqrt.m</a>.   We also developed a program,
<a href="plotMySqrt.m">plotMySqrt.m</a>, that plots the series of guesses.
