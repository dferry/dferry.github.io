<h3><a name="records">Case Study: Breaking Records</a></h3>

<p>
How often should you expect to have a truly record breaking year?
Suppose you have 100 years of weather data indicating how much precipitation
fell in each year. How many records to you expect to be set for wettest
or driest years on record? 
For example, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lsx/cli_archive">according to NOAA</a>,
St. Louis' official driest year had just 20.7 inches of precipitation in 1953,
and our wettest year had 61.2 inches in 2015. On average, we get about 43.4
inches of precipitation in a year.

<p>
In this class we will simulate weather data and compute how many
record highs and lows are seen. To do this, we build upon
our exercise from last time, the peak-finding function.


<h3><a name="peaks">Finding peaks</a></h3>

<p>
Given a vector, we have discussed the basic algorithm for fiding the
maximum, by keep track of the maximum thus far while iterating through
the vector.

<p>
Question: how many different elements qualify as being the 
maximum thus far during that process?

<p>
Goal: Develop a function <tt>peaks(v)</tt> that returns the number of
elements that have value surpassing all previous elements in the vector.
For example, <nobr><tt>peaks([5 1 8 3 8 11 10])</tt></nobr> should return
<tt>3</tt>, as the first element, the third element and the sixth
elements are new maximums (we do not count the fifth, because that
value 8 did not surpass the previously visited maximum of 8).


<p>
Goal: Rewrite the function so that it can provide a second return
value, which is a vector of indices achieving those peaks (akin to the
second return value of the built-in <tt>max</tt> function).  Thus
<nobr><tt>peaks([5 1 8 3 8 11 10])</tt></nobr> should return the pair
<nobr><tt>[ 3  [1 3 6] ]</tt></nobr>.

<h4>Files from Wednesday's class</h4>

We developed three function m-files during class.   Because these were
written on-the-fly, they may not be perfect examples of good style,
but the should suffice.
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="peaks.m">peaks.m</a>
      <br>
      The basic function for computing the number of peaks and their indices.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="harmonicTest.m">harmonicTest.m</a>
      <br>
      A function that performed tests by generating random vectors and
      counting the number of peaks in those vectors.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="graphHarmonic.m">graphHarmonic.m</a>
      <br>
      A function that produces a plot of the theoretical predicted
      number of peaks for random data versus the observed data for
      random trials.
  </li>
</ul>
