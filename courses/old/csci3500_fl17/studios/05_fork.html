<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fork and Exec</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">


<p>Executing processes is fundamentally the reason why operating systems
exist. Beyond that, it's an extremely common activity in modern systems- every
time you look at a file, compile a program, or execute a terminal command
you're probably creating at least one process, if not more. 
Understanding the <code>fork()</code> and <code>exec()</code> mechanisms
provided by the operating system will give you insight to the
process lifecycle in Linux.</p>


<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get process IDs with <code>getpid()</code>
	<li>Create new processes with <code>fork()</code>
	<li>Wait for child processes with <code>wait()</code>
	<li>Execute programs with <code>exec()</code>
</ol>

enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p>

Fork and Exec

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Every process in Linux (and other OSes) has a unique identifying
number called a <i>Process Identifier</i> (or PID). This number is used
whenever you need to programmatically reference or interact with a specific
process in the system.</p>

<p>Create a new program called <code>fork.c</code>. Use <code>printf()</code> 
and <code>getpid()</code> to print out the process' PID. Run the program
three times and copy-paste the output as the answer to this exercise.</p>


<p><li>Now we will create a new process. Recall from lecture that
this involves two different operations: <i><code>fork()</code>-ing</i> and
<i><code>exec()</code>-ing</i>. The <code>fork()</code> step creates a new
process (the "container" for executing a program), and the <code>exec()</code>
step loads and executes a desired program within that new process. </p>

<p>When <code>fork()</code> is called, the
system creates a near-identical replica of the calling process. After the
fork you will have two processes that both execute the same program. Insert
the call "<code>fork();</code>" immediately after the start of 
<code>main()</code> in your program <code>fork.c</code>, and
before the lines where you get the program PID and the print it out.</p>

<p>What happens when you run your program now? Copy and paste the output.</p>

<p><li>Look up the man page for <code>fork()</code>. This is a unique function
in that you get <i>two</i> return values for each valid call to
<code>fork()</code> (one in the parent, and another in the child). What are the
return values listed?</p>

<p><li>Use <code>fork()</code>'s return values to modify your program so that
the parent and child processes identify themselves as such when they print out
their PIDs. Copy and paste your program output. </p>

<p><li>Sometimes it is useful for a parent process to <i>wait</i> for one or
more child processes to finish executing. Otherwise, you might get undesirable
behavior, or behavior that doesn't make sense. The <code>sleep()</code>
function causes a program to suspend for a specified length of time before
continuting, and we can use it to pretend that the child process takes a long
time to execute. Modify your program so the child process executes the following call before it
prints out its PID:</p>

<p><code>sleep(3);</code></p>

<p>This will cause your child process to go to sleep for about three seconds
before printing its output. Now run your program... what happens? Does it
behave the way you would expect?</p>



<p><li>Because the child process takes a while to execute, we're in a situation
where it might make sense for the parent process to explicitly wait for the
child to finish. The <code>waitpid()</code> function will halt the parent until 
a desired child process returns. Modify your program so the parent process executes the following
call before it  prints out its PID:</p>

<p><code>waitpid( child_PID, NULL, 0 );</code></p>

<p>(The second and third parameters allow us some extra control over how this
function operates, but we don't need them for now.)</p>

<p>Execute your program again. How is the behavior different?</p>

<p><li>Lastly, we can use the exec family of functions so that the child
process can load and execute a new program on behalf of the parent. In
particular we will use the <code>execvp()</code> function. (There are many
forms of <code>exec()</code>, but this one is arguably the easiest to get
started with, see the rest at <code>man 3 exec</code>.)</p>

<p>Before we use <code>execvp()</code>, you should execute the command we
want to run so that you know what to expect. We're going to have our
child process execute the <code>ls</code> program in list-mode. Execute the
command "<code>ls -l</code>" and copy-paste the output as the answer to this
question.</p>

<p><li>Now we will create a new, <i>static</i>, argv variable for the
child. This is only useful when you know exactly what you're going
to execute when you're writing your program, but we will explore more flexible
methods in future studios. Create the following variables:</p>

<p><code>char* child_argv[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};</code><br>
<code>char* child_prog = child_argv[0];</code></p>

<p>Notice that <code>child_argv</code> has the exact same layout as if you were
to try and access <code>argv</code> in a regular program. Now, in the child 
process, insert the call:</p>

<p><code>execvp( child_prog, child_argv );</code></p>

<p>If everything is correct, you should see your child process execute the
"<code>ls -l</code>" command, and then your parent process should wait and
print out its PID. Copy and paste your program output as the answer to this
exercise.</p>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Rearrange your call to the <code>execvp()</code> function so that
you can call a different program with different arguments.</p>

<p><li>Rearrange your <code>execvp()</code> call so that you can execute an
arbitrary program, for example as a result of user input. This is a vital
part of Lab 2, and we will explore it further in a future studio.</p>

</ol>
