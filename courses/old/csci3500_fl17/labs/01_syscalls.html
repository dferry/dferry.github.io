<p>System calls are the fundamental API provided by an operating system
to application programs. For example, the <code>read()</code> and
<code>write()</code> system calls are the basic mechanisms for doing file
input and output in Linux. All other file I/O routines, such as C++'s stream
operators (<code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>) or Python's
file methods (<code>file.read()</code> and <code>file.write()</code>)
are built upon these C-interface system calls.</p>

<p>To make sure we never take these high-level interfaces for granted, we're 
going to work with Linux's system calls directly! We will use
Linux's file manipulation system calls to write a program that encrypts and
decrypts files.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>, <code>read()</code>,
and <code>write()</code> system calls to do file I/O
  <li>Use the <code>ecb_crypt()</code> GNU function to encrypt and decrypt
data, which implements a type of encryption called DES
  <li>Perform proper Linux-style error checking on all functions that may
return an error
</ol>

<p><h3>Program name</h3></p>
<p><code>encrypt</code> - encrypt or decrypt a file using DES encryption</p>

<p><h3>Usage</h3></p>
<p><code>encrypt &lt;key&gt; &lt;input file&gt; &lt;output file&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>key</code>: an 8 character string used as the DES key to encrypt/decrypt</p>
<p><code>input file</code>: the file to encrypt/decrypt</p>
<p><code>output file</code>: the result of the operation</p>
<p><code>mode</code>: specifies whether to encrypt or decrypt- if mode=0, then encrypt the input file, if mode=1 then decrypt the input file</p>


<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p><code>encrypt</code> will encrypt and decrypt files using the GNU C library
function <code>ecb_crypt()</code>. You must use the <code>read()</code> and
<code>write()</code> system calls (documented at <code>man 2 read</code> and
<code>man 2 write</code>, respectively) to read the input file and write to
the output file. </p>

<p><code>encrypt</code> detects the following errors and quits gracefully:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Not enough / too many command line arguments (and prints a usage statement)
<li>Key length other than 8 characters
<li>A mode value other than 0 or 1 (hint: use <code>strtol()</code>)
<li>Any errors returned from <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>,
<code>read()</code>, or <code>write()</code> - use the
function <code>perror()</code> to print useful error messages
</ul></p>

<p>Upon encountering any error, print a useful message and <code>exit()</code>
with a negative status code.</p>

<p>If no error is encountered then the program should not produce any output
to standard output.</p>

<p><h3>Test Input Files</h3></p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~ferryd/csci3500/labs/test1">test1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~ferryd/csci3500/labs/test2">test2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~ferryd/csci3500/labs/test3">test3</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p>You can download these files to your local machine with the
<code>wget</code> program from the Linux command line. See
<code>man wget</code> for details.</p> 

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>
<p><ol>
<li>Worry about the encryption last! First construct a working program that
just reads the input file and copies it to the output file. Once that works
you can add the encryption/decryption step.
<li>Here's a <a href="./crypt_example.c">demo file</a> showing how to use
<code>ecb_crypt()</code>
<li>Three test files are provided for you to experiment with. Each of them
test a different aspect of your program- make sure your program works with
all of them!
<li>Look at the man pages for all the functions you use. All of them will
give the possible return values as well as how errors are specified. 
<li>Use the <code>diff</code> program to compare files and highlight any
differences. This is an easy way to detect whether or not a decrypted file
is identical to the original source, especially when the files are too large
to inspect visually!
<li>Use the <code>wc</code> program to count how many characters are in a
file.
<li>The <code>read()</code> system call returns how many bytes it has read.
This is useful info needed for both <code>ecb_crypt()</code> and <code>write()
</code>. Keep reading the input until <code>read()</code> returns a 0 (end of
file) or -1 (error).
<li>You need to call the <code>des_setparity()</code> function on your key
before using the encryption function. This is due to the mathematics of
the DES encryption algorithm implemented by <code>ecb_crypt()</code>.
<li>The <code>ecb_crypt()</code> function works on arbitrarily long arrays
of data, but the total size must be evenly divisible by 8. If your message
is not divisible by 8, then you will need to pad it with blank space ' '
characters.
<li>If the number of characters in the input file is not divisible by 8 then
you don't need to remove the extra padding when you decrypt the file. If you
compare your two files with <code>diff</code> you will find a difference on
the last line. You can suppress this by using <code>diff -Z</code>.

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the name(s) of the people who
worked together on this lab.</p>

<p><li>Linux includes the nifty command <code>time</code>, which records how
long a command runs. Record how long it takes to encrypt the file <code>test3</code>.
The syntax in this case is "<code>time ./encrypt key 
test3 outfile 0</code>". This will report three measurements: real, user,
and sys. How long does your program take to run in real time? 

<p><li>The third parameter to the <code>read()</code> system call controls
how many characters can be read at a time. Try modifying this parameter to
use a few different values: 8, 80, 800, and 4096. Record how long it takes to
encrypt <code>test3</code> with each setting.</p>

<p><li>Is it faster to make many system calls that read a few characters, or to
make a few system calls that read many characters? Why do you think this is?
</p>

<p><li>Indicate which, if any, extra credit exercises have you have attempted.</p>
</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<ul>
<li><b>5% Extra Credit</b>: Implement a second encryption algorithm called
XOR encryption. This is a very simple encryption method where every character
of your read buffer is bitwise XOR'ed with a numeric value between 0 and 255.
Add an addtional command line parameter at the end of the command string that
must have the value XOR, DES, or be blank (defaults to DES). If this parameter
specifies XOR, then the key must be a number between 0 and 255, rather than
the usual DES key. For example:

<p><code>encrypt abcd1234 infile outfile 0 DES</code></p>

<p>should be equivalent to</p>

<p><code>encrypt abcd1234 infile outfile 0</code></p>

<p>However, specifying XOR encryption, as such:</p>

<p><code>encrypt 42 infile outfile 0 XOR</code></p>

<p>indicates that your program should encrypt the messages by bitwise XOR'ing each
character in the input file with the number 42. Decryption is accomplished by
XOR'ing each character in the encrypted file with the same value.</p>

<p>The fifth parameter must be one of DES, XOR, or blank. Any other value
should exit the program with a descriptive error message. The manual page
<code>strcmp(3)</code> will probably be helpful. Attempting to use DES
encryption with an XOR key, or vice-versa, should result in a
descriptive error message and exit.</p>

<li><p>The encryption we have used in this program is very weak! Not only is it
subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#Brute_force_attack">brute force attacks</a>, 
the particular variant we have used (ECB, which stands for Electronic Code
Book) will always encrypt the same source data with the same ciphertext. Does
this sound like a problem to you? Google "ecb penguin" to see what kinds of
statistical information your supposedly encrypted file can leave!</p> 

<li><p>The encryption program you've written should work on any type of file.
Try encrypting and decrypting different file types to see if this is really
the case. You should be able to use it on text, photos, videos,
even binary executable files! If you decrypt a binary executable file you
will need to mark it as executable with the command 
"<code>chmod u+x filename</code>"</p>
</ul>
