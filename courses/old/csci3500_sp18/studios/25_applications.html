<h2 style="text-align: center;">Layer 7: Application Layer</h2>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Application layer protocols allow different processes to communicate
with one another in an orderly and meaningful fashion. By agreeing on
a pre-arranged set of messages (the protocol) the two processes can
communicate to achieve every internet-enabled application you can think
of. Internet hostnames are translated to IP addresses with the DNS
protocol. Web browsers recieve web pages with the HTTP protocol. Servers
provide secure terminal access through the SSH protocol, and etcetera. 

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>In your previous studio you created a server and a client program where
the server would listen for connections from a client, and then echo the
contents of those messages to the output of the server. Your server would
also listen for a specific message ("quit") which would cause the server
to terminate. This demonstrated communication between a server and a client,
but without accomplishing anything meaningful. We will modify your server
and client so that the client can request a specific file be retrieved from
the server.</p>

<p>Modify your server so that it interprets incoming messages (other than 
"quit") as file names. It should attempt to open these files with the
<code>open()</code> or <code>fopen()</code> functions. Check the return value:
if you cannot open the file then return an error message to the client by
writing to the socket (the one returned by <code>accept()</code> in the
server). Otherwise, write the contents of the file to the socket. Once
the server is done writing (either the error message or the file contents)
you should terminate the server's end of the connection by calling
the function <code>shutdown()</code> with option <code>SHUT_RDWR</code>
(see <code>man 2 shutdown</code> for details).</p>

<p>Similarly, modify your client so that after sending its request it will
<code>read()</code> from the socket, printing everything it recieves to
standard output. Once the call to <code>read()</code> returns zero (signifying
there is nothing more to read from the socket) it should terminate.</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> We had several studios early on (two and four) that involved 
reading and reprinting text files through streams. Feel free to use this code 
again.</p>

<li><p>Now, add one more special context word along with "quit". If the client
sends the string "ls" then the server should execute the command <code>ls</code>
and send the result back to the client. I would suggest you do this with the
<code>popen()</code> function documented at <code>man 3 popen</code>. Note that
this function returns a <code>FILE*</code> type, so you will need to use
<code>fgets()</code> to read from the returned file pointer.</p> 

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Create a more complex protocol that involves telling the server whether
to send or recive a file from the client. If the client wants to read a file
then the server should behave as above. If the client wants to send a file then
the server should write the contents from the scocket into the desried file.
Now you can save and restore files on a remote server!</p>
