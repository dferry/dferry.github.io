<p><h3>Usage:</h3></p>

<p><code>server &lt;IP address&gt; &lt;port number&gt;<br>
client &lt;IP address&gt; &lt;port number&gt;</code></p>


<p><h3>Description</h3></p>

<p>
The goal of this assignment is to write a networked chat server and client.
Multiple users will connect concurrently to a single server process via
individual chat clients. The client program will send messages from 
users to the server, and will print messages from the server to the user's
terminal screen. The server will keep track of connected clients, and when
it recieves a message from any client it will pass that message along to
all other connected clients. Each user will also have a name that is used
to identify their statements.</p>

<p>Each user, when they first connect, should get a default name
consisting of the string "User" followed by a unique set of digits.
When a user connects to the server any other connected users should
recieve a message stating "<code>&lt;user name&gt; has connected</code>".</p>

<p>Additionally, the client will support two
special commands <code>name</code> and <code>quit</code>.</p>

<p><code>name</code> command: When the client enters the phrase "<code>name</code>"
followed by a space and at least one character, everything after the space
will become the user's name. The system will then send this name in front of
any subsequent chat messages. If the user specifies another name their current
name is replaced. Lastly, when any
user changes their name then all other users should recieve the message
"<code>&lt;old name&gt; has changed their name to &lt;new name&gt;</code>"</p>

<p><code>quit</code> command: When the client enters the phrase "<code>quit</code>"
the client program will terminate. All other connected users should recieve
the message "&lt;user name&gt; has quit".</p>

<p>Messages should always be printed to all terminals in less than a second,
regardless of the current state of the system. (This means that your client
should be able to display text even while waiting for input, and your
server should be able to respond to an incoming request by <i>any</i>
client at <i>any</i> time.)</p>

<p>If a client suddenly finds its socket to be closed then it should quit
and print a message saying the server shut down unexpectedly. If the
server finds a socket unable to be used it should print the same message
as though the user quit normally.</p>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>

<ul>

<p><li>Test all your code locally. Specifying an IP address of <code>127.0.0.1</code>
(the loopback address) will cause all traffic to stay local. Using this IP
you can run your client and your server on the same machine. I won't require you
to test your code across the internet, but it should work in theory. (Things
like firewalls can make this harder than it it first seems. I'm happy to give advice
on how to get this running if you'd like.)</p>

<p><li>Your programs should accept any port number, but in practice you probably want
to use a large, random number. Better yet, look up a list of commonly used ports
online and pick one that's not used.</p>

<p><li>Your server and each of your clients must specify the <i>same</i> port number
to communicate. How do you tell clients apart? The sockets interface makes this
easy! You might have noticed in the studio that your server gets a
different file descriptor from <code>accept()</code> than from <code>socket()</code>.
In fact, <code>accept()</code> returns a different descriptor for each 
individual connection.</p>

<p><li>As a distributed system, some features (like keeping track of a name) may be done in the
client or in the server. It's up to you to decide how to implement features.</p>

<p><li>The client should be prepared to display a message at all times, even if the
program is also waiting for user input. A great way to accomplish this is to use
a <code>pthread</code> to wait for server messages and print them to the
screen when they arrive. Don't worry about incoming messages messing up the display
of half-written messages.</p>

<p><li>The first major challenge in your server is keeping track of an arbitrary number of
clients that can connect and drop out at any time. This requires a data structure
such as a linked list. Thankfully you can rely on library functions such as <code>malloc</code>
this time around. </p>

<p><li>The second major challenge in writing your server is the asynchronous nature of the system.
Your server needs to be able to respond to a message from any client quickly, and
in particular your server cannot block (wait) on calls to <code>read()</code> sockets
or calls to <code>accept()</code> new connections. You can set sockets to be
<i>nonblocking</i>. With a nonblocking socket calls to <code>read()</code> will fail and
return an error if there is nothing to read. Similarly, calls to <code>accept()</code>
will fail and return an error if there are no new connections to accept. In both
cases the function returns an error value and sets <code>errno</code> to be one of
<code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>.</p>

<p><li>Search the <code>accept4()</code> man page and the <code>socket()</code> man page
for the phrase "<code>SOCK_NONBLOCK</code>" for details on how to make sockets
nonblocking. You will want to set the socket returned from <code>socket()</code>
as nonblocking, as well as the sockets returned from <code>accept()</code> (for
this second one, use the <code>accept4()</code> variant).</p>

<p><li>Use <code>sprintf()</code> to format strings (char buffers) easily. For example, if you
have a <code>name</code> string and a <code>message</code> string, and you want to
combine these into a <code>toSend</code> string, you can use something like:</p>

<p><code>sprintf(toSend, "%s: %s", name, message);</code></p>

<p>If you find yourself wanting to use <code>strcpy()</code> or <code>strncpy()</code>,
consider using <code>sprintf()</code> instead.</p>

<p><li>Make sure your client only uses the commands <code>name</code> and <code>quit</code>
when it is appropriate. You shouldn't let clients set their names to be empty. The
client shouldn't quit on the input "quite right!"</p>

<p><li>Each client should only make one connection. Call <code>connect()</code>
only once in your client code. In particular, don't call <code>connect()</code>
every time you send a message. The connection that is established can be used
over and over.</code></p>

<p><h3>Submission</h3></p>
<p>Create a .tgz archive of your lab directory and email it to
<code><big><b>dferry@slu.edu</b></big></code>.
Your submission must contain a file <code>malloc.c</code>
which contains definitions for <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>,
<code>realloc</code>, <code>calloc</code> but has no <code>main()</code>
and with all output (<code>cout</code>, <code>printf</code>) removed.

<p>The simple syntax for creating a .tgz archive is as follows:</p>

<p><code>tar -zvcf new_archive.tgz lab_directory</code></p>

<p>The syntax for unpacking a .tgz archive is:</p>

<p><code>tar -zvxf archive.tgz</code></p>

<p>Note that your archive <b>must not</b> include any binary executable files,
meaning any compiled programs or intermediate build objects (.o files, for
example). This will cause your email to be rejected by most services.</p>
