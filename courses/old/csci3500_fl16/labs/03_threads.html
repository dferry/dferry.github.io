<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Lab 3<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><code>crack</code> - Brute Force Password Cracking</h2>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Modern computers overwhelmingly use multi-core architectures. Exploiting
this hardware for parallel programming (creating a program that executes
simultaneously on more than one processor core) requires the use of multiple
threads. We will use one of the most basic threading interfaces,
Pthreads, to create a multi-threaded password cracking program.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>crypt()</code> and <code>crypt_r()</code> to guess password hashes
<li>Iterate over aribtrary length strings with characters from 'a' to 'z'
<li>Create and wait for threads with <code>pthread_create()</code> and <code>pthread_join()</code>
<li>Divide work between multiple parallel threads
</ol>

assignment.</p>

<p><h3>Usage</h3></p>

<code>crack &lt;threads&gt; &lt;keysize&gt; &lt;target&gt;</code>


<p><h3>Description</h3></p>

<p><code>crack</code> should attempt to find the password associated to the target DES hash.
It does this by trying all possible lowercase alphabetic (a-z) passwords of length
up to <code>keysize</code>. The program should run with <code>threads</code> concurrent threads for
speed.</p>

<p>
Linux/Unix user passwords are never stored on the system. Instead, a function
called a hash is applied to the password. Then, the hashed password is stored,
traditionally in /etc/passwd or more recently in /etc/shadow.
The classic hash function on Unix systems is crypt(3). To make things harder
on crackers, crypt also uses a two character string called a salt which it combines
with the password to create the hash. Schematically:</p>

<p><code>password + salt =&gt; crypt() =&gt; hash</code></p>


<p>The salt is visible in the hash as the first two characters. As an example, a
password <code>'apple'</code> and salt <code>'na'</code> become the hash <code>'na3C5487Wz4zw'</code>.</p>

<p>
The crack program should extract the salt from the first two characters of
target, then repeatedly call <code>crypt()</code> using all possible passwords built of up to
<code>keysize</code> lowercase alphabetic characters.
</p>

<p>
When a match to <code>target</code> is found, the program should print the cracked password
and exit immediately. If the entire space of passwords is searched with no
match, the program should exit with no output.
</p>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>

<p>
Start by writing a short program that uses <code>crypt()</code> to encrypt a
given password and salt. You can also encrypt using
the one line perl command: <code>perl -e 'print crypt("apple","na")'</code>
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to compile with the -lpthread and -lcrypt options.
</p>

<p>
The maximum allowed keysize is 8 (since crypt only uses the first 8 characters
of the password anyway).
</p>

<p>
You might want to write this first as a single threaded program. Just remember
that <code>crypt()</code> won't work with multiple threads - you need to switch to <code>crypt_r()</code>.
</p>
<p>
You need to check passwords of length <code>keysize</code>, but don't forget you also need
to check the shorter ones. The simplest way is probably to write a function that
checks all passwords which are exactly a given length, and then have main call
it in a loop from 1 to <code>keysize</code>.

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list your name.</p>

<p><li>What four-letter password corresponds to the following target: '<code>abccBcrPOxnLU</code>'?</p>

<p><li>What five-letter password corresponds to the following target: '<code>xyxMB6gxuiBZg</code>'?</p>

<p><li>The following hash does not correspond to any password, so your program will exhaust the entire search
space without finding any match. Use the <code>time</code> command to measure how long your program takes to
search the entire space of five-letter passwords. Hash '<code>nomatchingpass</code>'</p>

<p><li>Re-run the previous experiment but with two threads, four threads, six threads, eight threads,
ten threads, and twelve threads. Record how long each run takes.</p>

<p><li>Calculate the <i>speedup</i> your program gets as a result of using multiple threads. The speedup is
defined to be the execution time with one thread divided by the execution time with multiple threads. Do this
for each of the two, four, six, eight, ten, and twelve threads.</p>

<p><li>Plot your program's speedup versus number of threads on a graph. Save your graph as a graphics
file such as png or jpg and submit it alongside these answers.</p>

<p><li>Interpret the results on your graph. Does your program run twice as fast with two threads? Does it
run ten times faster with ten threads? How does this relate to the way you have written your program?</p>

<p><li>Use one thread and run your program against the hash '<code>nomatchingpass</code>' for keysizes of one, two, three,
four, and five. Time each execution. Estimate how long it takes to run your program for keysizes of six, seven, and eight.

<p><li>Describe any known bugs or ways that your submission deviates from the
above specification.</p>

<p><h3>Submission</h3></p>
<p>Create a .tgz archive of your lab directory and email it to
<code><big><b>dferry@slu.edu</b></big></code>.
Your submission must include a makefile
that will compile your program by simply issuing the command
<code>make</code>. You must also include a text file with your

<p><code>tar -zvxf archive.tgz</code></p>

<p>Note that your archive <b>must not</b> include any binary executable files,
meaning any compiled programs or intermediate build objects (.o files, for
example). This will cause your email to be rejected by most services.</p>
