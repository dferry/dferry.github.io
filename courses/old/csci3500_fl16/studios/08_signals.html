<h2 style="text-align: center;">Signals</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p><i>Signals</i> are a mechanism for basic inter-process notification and
event handling. Signals do not convey any data in themselves, 
but they do allow cooperating processes to invoke remote functions in other
processes. In addition, signals are the mechanism central to handling certain
basic functions you expect from an operating system, such as the ability to
interrupt, suspend, or otherwise modify a currently running program.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send signals with keyboard shortcuts
<li>Customize signal handling behavior by registering signal handlers
</ol>

<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file. When finished, submit your work by sending your text file and
source code to <strong>dferry@slu.edu</strong>
with the phrase <strong>
Signal Handling
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Download the program <a href="./sleep.c">sleep.c</a>. This program
runs an infinte loop in a way that doesn't burn a lot of CPU cycles. Compile
and run this program to see what it does. Use CTRL-C to stop the program.</p>

<p>Copy and paste some program output as the answer to this exercise.</p>


<p><li>When you press CTRL-C on the keyboard you're actually generating a
special signal called the <i>interrupt signal</i>, or <i>SIGINT</i> for short.
The default behavior of this signal is to kill the recieving process, and since 
most programs don't handle this signal with customized behavior the result
is normally that the process is killed.</p>

<p>Open the manual page at <code>man 7 signal</code>. Scroll down to the	
list of standard signals. What numeric value does SIGINT have? What is the
associated comment?</code>


<p><li>Open a second terminal. Start the <code>sleep.c</code> program in the
first terminal and make a note of its PID. In the second terminal use the
<code>kill</code> command documented at <code>man 1 kill</code> to send the
SIGINT signal to the sleeping process. <i>(Note- despite the name, the
<code>kill</code> command can send any signal to a process, not just the
kill signal!</i>. The syntax for doing this is below:</p>

<p><code>kill -s &lt;signal number&gt; &lt;pid&gt;</code></p> 

<p>What happens to the sleeper process?</p>

<p><li>Go back to <code>man 7 signal</code> and look through the list of
standard signals. Pick another signal to send to a sleeping process.
What signal did you pick? What happened? Copy and paste the results.</p>

<p><li>Now download the program <a href="./call_sleeper.c">
call_sleeper.c</a>. This program <code>fork()</code>s and
<code>exec()</code>s a sleeper program, and then waits for it to
finish. After the child returns it will print out a success message.</p>

<p>Try running <code>call_sleeper.c</code> and then terminating the
sleeper with CTRL-C. Which processes terminate: the sleeper, the caller, or
both? Did the calling program print its success message?</p>

<p><li>We want to be able to interrupt the sleeper process without
interrupting the caller process. To do so, we can define a custom <i>signal
handler</i> that intercepts the SIGINT and ignores it. To do so, we can use
the <code>signal()</code> system call that is documented at <code>man 2
signal</code>.</p>

<p><i>Note: This is an newer function called <code>sigaction()</code> that is
the newer, better way to do this. However, the interface is much more
complicated (but flexible!) so we will use this function instead.</i></p>

<p>First you will need to write the signal handler function. This function
should have the signature:</p>

<p><code>void &lt;function_name&gt; ( int signum )</code></p>

<p>In the body of that function, print a message stating that your program is
ignoring SIGINT. Then, in the <code>main()</code> function, make a call to
<code>signal()</code>. The first parameter should be the signal number for
SIGINT and the second should be the name of your signal handler function.</p>

<p>Copy and paste your signal handling code.</p>


<p><li>Finally, run your new caller program and interrupt it with CTRL-C. If
done correctly, your sleeper should terminate but your caller should simply
print your statement that SIGINT is being ignored. Then, the caller will
print a statement indicating that it successfully waited for the sleeper.</p>

<p>Copy and paste your program output.</p>

<i>NOTE: Once you handle SIGINT in this way, you will no longer be able to
kill your process with CTRL-C. If you run into trouble you can still terminate
your program with CTRL-\, which sends the SIGQUIT signal.</i>

<p><li>Signals are frequently used in computer systems to do
<i>asynchronous event handling</i>- dealing with events that can't
be predicted accurately. One example might be clicking the red X box on a
GUI window to close a program. In this case the OS might send a signal to the
GUI process to tell it to terminate. Give another situation where signal
handling might be useful.</p>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
<p><li>One frequently used program that handles SIGINT with a custom handler
is the terminal shell. Try pressing CTRL-C at an empty terminal- what happens?
Why is this behavior important?</p> 
<p><li>Linux provides two user-defined signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 specifically
for implementing program functionality on top of signals. Try using the system
call documented at <code>man 2 kill</code> to implement asynchronous
program communication. For example, have one process wait in a loop until it
recieves SIGUSR1, and then perform some useful work.</p>
