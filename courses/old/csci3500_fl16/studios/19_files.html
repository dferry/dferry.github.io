<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 19<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Files</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Files are the fundamental abstraction of storage media. 
User data is stored in files on disks- so files must support reading
and writing data, as well as facilitating the storage and location of
data on disk when it is needed. 

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Examine ASCII text files
<li>Examine executable ELF files
</ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file. When finished, submit your work by sending your text file and
source code to <strong>dferry@slu.edu</strong>
with the phrase <strong>
Files
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Files are the essential storage medium for data on a computer. Create
an empty file using the <code>touch</code> command:</p>

<p><code>touch test.txt</code></p>

<p>Use the command "<code>ls -l</code>" to list all of the files in the current
directory. What are the permissions on your new file?</p>

<p><li>What is the new file size given by the ls command?</p>

<p><li>Go ahead and fill your new file with at least 50 characters of text
using a text editor of your choice. What is displayed in your text editor is
not necessarily everything that is saved on disk. 
Use the <code>xxd</code> program
to display the individual bytes of your file. Copy and paste
the results.</p>

<p><li>Make a few different text files with different contents. Is there anything
stored in the file that would let you know that this file is an ASCII text file?</p>

<p><li>Identify at least one character saved in the file that is not printed
to the screen.</p>

<p><li>Find a few executable files. We can also use <code>xxd</code> to
look at the byte-level data of these files as well. Print their contents to
your console- what are the first four bytes (eight hex digits) of each file?</p>

<p><li>Look through your executable files- do you recognize any other data
in there? Copy and paste some section of the program output and speculate
about what it is.</p>

<p><li>The program <code>xxd</code> is neat, but not very useful for analyzing
executable files. Fortunately, there is a special program designed to do just
that. Find an executable file and call it with the program <code>readelf</code>:</p>

<p><code>readelf -h your_program</code></p>

<p>This prints some basic information about your program. Pick out and explain
two lines of this output.</p>

<p><li>This tool provides a lot of output. Now call the readelf program with the
"-a" flag instead of the "-h" flag. What <i>offset</i> does the .text segment
of your program start at? Copy and paste the relevant line. Hint- look at the
program segment table.</p>

<p><li>What byte does the start of your <code>main</code> function reside? Hint- look at the symbol table.</p> 

</ol>
