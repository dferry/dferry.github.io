<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 18<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>The translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a special hardware cache that
speeds up accesses to a process' page table. Even though a process can
theoretically access its full virtual memory space, most processes access
much less. The princple of the TLB is that, ideally, most programs will
only access a very small subset of their total space. If all pages can
be kept in the TLB, then memory accesses will be very fast.

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Analyze TLB function
<li>Analyze TLB effect

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><b>For the following exercises, consider the following page table which.
Suppose a page size of 1024 bytes:
</b></p>

<table border="2">
	<tr>
		<th>Page<br>(in binary)</th>
		<th>Page Frame<br>(in binary)</th>
		<th>Valid</th>
		<th>Modified</th>
		<th>Permissions</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0000</td>
		<td>10011</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>r</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0001</td>
		<td>10100</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rw</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0010</td>
		<td>00101</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>rx</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0011</td>
		<td>10111</td>
		<td>1</td>

<p><b>Furthermore, suppose this machine has a TLB with the following contents:</b></p>

<table border="2">
	<tr>
		<th>Page<br>(in binary)</th>
		<th>Page Frame<br>(in binary)</th>
		<th>Referenced</th>

<p><li>Does an access to the virtual address <code>00110011110011</code> cause
a TLB hit?</p>

<p><li>Does an access to the virtual address <code>00010011001110</code> cause
a TLB hit?</p>

<p><li>Like page frames in physical memory, the system has to have a policy for
evicting entries in the TLB when it needs to make room for a new entry.
Recall the <i>Not Recently Used (NRU)</i> page replacement policy, which is an
approximxation of the <i>Least Recently Used (LRU)</i> policy. Under 
NRU, pages are evicted in the order of class:</p>

<p>Class 0 - not referenced, not modified<br>
Class 1 - not referenced, modified<br>
Class 2 - referenced, not modified<br>
Class 3 - referenced, modified</p>

<p>Under the NRU policy, which page in the page table would be evicted next?</p>

<p><li>Which three pages remain in the TLB after the following memory accesses?
Assume the TLB starts in the configuration presented above, and that it uses
the NRU replacement policy. New pages start with the referenced bit
set to one.</p>

<code>
00110010010000 - read<br>
00100000111011 - read<br>
00110000101110 - read<br>
00110000010101 - write<br>
00010001000010 - write<br>
01100000100001 - read<br>
01010010011100 - read<br>
</code>

<p><li>Suppose you're a computer engineer tasked with designing a chip's TLB.
You write a program to simulate a basic TLB as though
it ran a program with 100000 memory accesses. You assume that when a memory
access hits in the TLB it will take 1 cycle, but when an access misses it will
take 30 cycles.</p>

<p>In your first design you hit 90% of the time and miss 10% of the time- that is,
you have 10,000 TLB misses and 90,000 TLB hits. How many cycles does your program
spend on TLB misses? How many cycles does it spend on TLB hits? How many total
cycles does your program spend on memory accesses?</p> 

<p><li>What is the <i>average</i> number of cycles spent on memory accesses? (Total
number of cycles divided by number of accesses.)</p>

<p><li>You have a budget to improve your TLB, so
you can't make everything great. You come up with two improved designs.
</p>

<p>In your first plan, you're able to reduce the TLB miss time from 30 cycles
to 20 cycles. Given the same program as above, how many total cycles does the
program spend on memory accesses? What is the average number of cycles per
access?</p>

<p><li>For your second alternative, you're able to reduce the TLB miss rate from
10% to 1%. That is- you have 1,000 TLB misses and 99,000 TLB hits. How many
cycles does your program spend on memory accesses? What is the average
number of cycles per access?</p>

<p><li>Which design is better? By how many cycles? How much better is it as
a ratio?</p>
