<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 11<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mutexes</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p><i>Mutual exclusion</i> is an important concept in concurrent and parallel
programming where different threads of execution cooperate to avoid causing
racy program behavior. This exclusion is encapsulated at a high level in an
object called a <i>mutex</i>. A mutex allows for protection of shared data
by allowing cooperating threads to <i>lock</i> the mutex and thereby claim the
exclusive use of critical data.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Pthreads mutex
<li>Use a single mutex to coordinate shared access to a variable
<li>Measure the overhead of using a mutex
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>First, make a copy of your code from the previous studio where we
created a race condition. Our goal today is to fix that race condition.
We will do this by creating a <code>pthread_mutex_t</code> object,
initializing it, and then locking and unlocking this mutex around the critical
section.</p>

<p>Create your <code>pthread_mutex_t</code> object with the help of the man
page at <code>man pthread_mutex_init</code>. You may intialize your object
with the static initializer (<code>PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</code>) or with
the <code>pthread_mutex_init()</code> function (if you use this second
you can leave the <code>pthread_mutexattr_t</code> pointer NULL). 
Create this mutex inside your
<code>main()</code> function. Copy and paste your mutex creation code.</p>

<p><li>Now you must pass a mutex pointer from your <code>main()</code> function
to the <code>adder()</code> and <code>subtractor()</code> functions from last
time. Pass these pointers through the fourth parameter of 
<code>pthread_create()</code>. Leave this answer blank.</p>

<p><li>Take a moment to consider our goal. Previously, the simultaneous
accesses to your variable caused some data corruption. What do you think the
result will be if you synchronize your accesses? What will be the numeric
value? How will this effect the amount of time your program takes to run?</p>

<p><li>Now, use the functions <code>pthread_mutex_lock()</code> and
<code>pthread_mutex_unlock()</code> to synchronize access to the racy
variable. This means that your threads should not modify this variable unless
they have successfully locked the mutex, and after modifying the variable they
should unlock the mutex.</p>

<p>Run your program many times. Does your program output match your
expectations? Copy and paste several program outputs.</p>

<p><li>Now we want to quantify the overhead of using this mutex. Locking and
unlocking the mutex is not free, but it is the cost we pay for correct
behavior.
Go back to your original racy program from the previous studio. Modify the
number of iterations each thread performs to be twenty million
(20,000,000). Take three timings of this program with the <code>time</code>
utility. Copy and paste your program output, and calculate the average time.
</p>

<p><li>Go back into your corrected program that uses your mutex. Set the number
of iterations to be twenty million (20,000,000). You might
have noticed that there are two possibilites for where you put your locking
and unlocking code. You can have each thread perform one lock and unlock
operation in total, or you can have each thread perform one lock and unlock
operation for each individual increment or decrement of the racy variable.</p>

<p>Modify your program, if necessary, so that each thread locks and unlocks 
the mutex
once per increment or decrement (that is, each thread should lock and unlock
the mutex twenty million times. Take three time measurements, copy and paste 
your output, and compute the average. How much longer did this execution
take?
</p>

<p><li>Modify your program so that you lock and unlock the mutex
just once per thread. Repeat your timing experiment and copy/paste the output.
How does this time compare to the original, racy program?</p>

<p><li>Speculate about what might cause the results from the previous
exercise.</p>

<p><li>Think of an example of where the first, per-iteration locking strategy
might be more appropriate. Where might the second, per-thread locking strategy
be more appropriate? </p>
