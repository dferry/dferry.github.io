<p>
Our goal for this assignment is to write a program that simulates the
following model for fire growth.   We assume that we have a
rectangular grid with a fixed number of rows and columns.  Initially,
the grid is presumed to have trees that can fuel a fire.  We then
simulate a fire that starts at a specified cell of the grid.  At each
step, the fire burns out all of the fuel of its current cell, while
moving to an adjacent cell that still has fuel (horizontally or
vertically;  <em>not diagonally</em>).  In particular, if there is a
choice of neighboring cells having fuel, it picks one of those choices
uniformly at random for the next step.

A trial should end when the fire either reaches a cell at the boundary
of the grid, or when it reaches a location in which all neighboring
squares have already been visited, in which case the fire burns out.


<p>
Create a file <tt>fire.m</tt> implementing a function with the
following specifications.
<pre>
function  outcomes = fire(numRows, numCols, startRow, startCol, trials)
% Simulate the spread of a fire.
% USAGE: outcomes = fire(numRows, numCols, startRow, startCol, trials)
%    The simulation will be performed on a grid with
%    specified number of rows and columns, assumed to be numbered
%    starting at (1,1) at the top-left.  The fire begins at location
%    (startRow, startCol) within that grid.
%    
%    An individual trial will have one of five outcomes:
%    1) it reaches the right edge of the grid
%    2) it reaches the bottom edge of the grid
%    3) it reaches the left edge of the grid
%    4) it reaches the top edge of the grid
%    5) it burns out within the grid
%    The returned outcome will be a row-vector of length five
%    designating the percentage of trials that resulted in
%    such outcomes. For example, the value outcomes(5) is the
%    percentage of trials that burned out.
%
%    input argument trials specifies the number of independent
%    trials.  If not specified, one trial will be performed.
%
%    When only one trial is to be performed, the function animates
%    the spread of the fire.

<a name="image"><h3>Creating Images in Matlab</h3></a>

<p>
Given a matrix of integers, you can plot an image based on the use of
those integers as indices into a prescribed colormap.  The syntax
as <tt>image(A)</tt> where <tt>A</tt> is the matrix of numbers.

<p>
For our images, we simply use three colors, with color 1 being the
forest green, color 2 being the fiery orange, and color 3 being the
burnt-out gray. We set that colormap with the following command.
<pre>
  colormap([.035 .200 .153; 1.00 .367 .063; .561 .510 .592])   % rgb values for green, orange, gray
</pre>

<p>
For example, try copy-pasting these three lines into a script. Then, change the <tt>map</tt> matrix
to modify the image.
<pre>
colormap([.035 .200 .153; 1.00 .367 .063; .561 .510 .592])   % rgb values for green, orange, gray
map = [ 1 1 1 1; 3 3 3 1; 2 3 3 1 ];
image(map);
</pre>

</p>

<a name="extra"><h3>Extra Credit (2 points)</h3></a>

<p>
Write a separate function <tt>fireExtra.m</tt> that does the same
simulation, except this time allowing the fire to spread diagonally as
well as horizontally and vertically.  At each step, if there are
multiple choices for the fire to spread, each should have an equal
probability of being picked.  Also, if it happens that the simulation
ends with the fire at a corner of the grid, credit 1/2 an outcome for
each of the two boundaries.
