Consider the following image
<br>
<br>
<a href="original.png"><img src="original.png"></a>

<p>
Now, consider this second image
<br>
<br>
<a href="watermarked.png"><img src="watermarked.png"></a>

<p>
While they may look the same, they are not.  The first version is an
original photo downloaded from SLU's website.  The second version
is a modified version in which we have hidden additional information
using a technique known as digital watermarking, explained below.

<hr>

<p>
This particular photo has 800&nbsp;x&nbsp;600 pixels, with each pixel
having "true color".  Namely, each pixel has its own "rgb" value, with
8&nbsp;bits to describe the intensity of red, 8&nbsp;bits to describe
the green, and 8&nbsp;bits to describe the blue.  This means that each
color is described using a magnitude from 0 to 255.  In MATLAB, the
array representing this image is such that <tt>A(:, :, 1)</tt>
contains the red channel intensities, <tt>A(:, :, 2)</tt> green, and
<tt>A(:, :, 3)</tt> blue.


<p>
Our watermarking scheme is based on the fact that a viewer is very
unlikely to notice minor discrepencies in those magnitudes.  In
particular, it is nearly impossible to visually detect the difference, for
example, between a red magnitude of 187 versus 188.   So we can reset
the lowest-order bit for each of the three colors, for each of the
pixels in the image.   This allows us to embed additional binary data.

<p>
For today's exercise, you are to retrieve the following three types of
information from the watermarked version of the above photo.

<ol type=1>
  <li>
      <em>red channel</em><br>
      We have used the lowest order bits of the red channel to embed a
      bitmap image.  For each (row,column) of the original photo, if
      that low order bit is a zero it represents white in the hidden
      image, and if the low order bit is one it represents black in
      the hidden image.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <em>green channel</em><br>
      In the green channel, we manipulate the low order bits to encode
      a text representation.  In particular, the 600x800 pixel image
      gives us 480000 low-order bits in the green channel.  So we have
      used those bits to write a message in ASCII.

      <p>
      Specifically, we consider the one-dimensional sequence of bits
      that results if taking the low-order green bit in "column major"
      order (that is, the first column from top to bottom, then the
      second colum from top to bottom).  Our reason for using that
      convention is that it is exactly what you get is you "reshape"
      the green subarray into a one-dimensional array.  That is, if
      you have the green "subarray" as an array <tt>G</tt>, syntax
      <tt>G(r,c)</tt> can be used to index the array by row and
      column, but <tt>G(k)</tt> is the k<sup><small>th</small></sup>
      entry of the array when viewed one-dimesionally.

      <p>
      The text can be reassembled by taking each group of
      8&nbsp;consecutive bits and recomputing the binary integer value
      that they represent (each being from 0 to 255).  Once you have
      those integers, you can have MATLAB view those as characters
      using the <tt>char(&nbsp;)</tt> function.
      
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <em>blue channel</em><br>
      In the blue channel, we again use the column-major order of
      pixels to hide a binary sequence, this time encoding an audio
      clip (in mono).  The audio clip uses 16&nbsp;bits per sample and
      a sample rate of 8000 samples per second.
      While similar in style to our ASCII encoding of characters,
      there is an additional challenge for retrieving the audio.  

      <p>
      When dealing with text, the 8-bit integers were interpretted
      naturally as "unsigned" integers, namely having non-negative
      value from 0 to 255.
      In the case of audio, the 16-bits represent the amplitude
      of a sample as a <em>signed integer</em>, allowing for the
      possibility of negative numbers.  The standard representation
      for signed integers uses a convention known as
      <em>twos-complement</em>.

      <p>
      In short, if you first compute the unsigned interpretation of a
      16&nbsp;bit number, you can convert it to the signed
      interpretation as follows:
      <ul>
	<li>
	    If the unsigned integer is a value <em>val</em> that is
	    strictly less than 
	    2<sup><small>15</small></sup>, the signed interpretation
	    is also <em>val</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
	    If the unsigned integer is a value <em>val</em> that is
	    greater than or equal to  2<sup><small>15</small></sup>,
	    then it should be interpretted as the negative number
	    <nobr><em>(val - 2<sup><small>16</small></sup>)</em></nobr>.
	</li>
      </ul>
      
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Other digital watermarking techniques</h3>

<p>
Although our algorithm for watermarking worked for hiding information
within the photo, this would not suffice for the purpose of copyright
protection.   The problem is that the owner of the photograph could
trivially randomize those lower order bits, destroying our information
without significantly degrading the image quality.  The goal of
watermarks in industry is to embed information in a file in a way that
remains permanent, even when non-destrutive modifications are made.
