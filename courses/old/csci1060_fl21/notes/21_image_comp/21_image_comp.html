Finding components of an image
</H2>

<hr>


Here are six different
versions of a function for finding components of an image, as well as
two sample images (billiken.gif and billiken.png).

<p>
<b>m-files</b>
<br>
<ol type=1>
  <li>
      <a href="findComponent1.m"><tt>findComponent1.m</tt></a><br>
      A "depth-first" exploration, that maintains a fringe in similar
      form to our maze solver, always expanding one-step from the end
      of the fringe, or removing that end if no further steps are possible.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="findComponent2.m"><tt>findComponent2.m</tt></a><br>
      The same exploration approach as <tt>findComponent1.m</tt>, but
      this time implemented using a recursive function, rather than an
      explicit management of the fringe.   From each spot, we
      recursively explore all of its legal neighbors, in turn.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="findComponent3.m"><tt>findComponent3.m</tt></a><br>
      A variant of the first program in which we add all legal
      neighbors of a position to the fringe and the component at once
      (the original program would add one neighbor of a given
      position, then iterate an exploration of that neighbor, and then
      later add another neighbor of the given position).
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="findComponent4.m"><tt>findComponent4.m</tt></a><br>
      A "breadth-first" variant of <tt>findComponenet3.m</tt>.  When
      choosing which item of the fringe to explore next, this variants
      chooses the <em>first</em> entry of the fringe rather than the
      last.  The first entry is the earliest fringe element to have
      been discovered.   This breadth-first variant can be used to
      find shortest paths from the starting point, as it first finds
      all locations that are one step from the start, then all that
      are two steps from the start, and so on.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="findComponent5.m"><tt>findComponent5.m</tt></a><br>
      A variant of <tt>findComponent4.m</tt> in which we relax the
      requirement that a neighboring color be an exact match to be
      included in the component.
      <p>
      This version is written for images (such as
      <tt>billiken.gif</tt>) that use a color map.  In this case, we
      can not determine the similarity between colors by the color
      indices, but rather must go into the color map to get the
      (r,g,b) values associated with two different indices.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="findComponent6.m"><tt>findComponent6.m</tt></a><br>
      A variant of <tt>findComponent4.m</tt> in which we relax the
      requirement that a neighboring color be an exact match to be
      included in the component.
      <p>
      This version is written for images (such as
      <tt>billiken.png</tt>) that provide full (r,g,b) color
      information in the image array.
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Images</b>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="billiken.gif"><tt>billiken.gif</tt></a>
      <br>
      <img src="billiken.gif">
      <p>
      You may load this file in MATLAB using the command
      <pre>
      [A map] = imread('billiken.gif');
      </pre>
      The array <tt>A</tt> is a 126-by-126 array of 8-bit integers
      that are indices into a colormap.  <tt>map</tt> is a 256-by-3
      array that provides the (r,g,b) values for the color indices.
      For example, <tt>map(k, :)</tt> is a vector of length three with
      the corresponding red, green, and blue values (between 0.0 and 1.0)
      for index&nbsp;<tt>k</tt> of the color map.
  </li>
      <br>
  <li>
      <a href="billiken.png"><tt>billiken.png</tt></a><br>
      <img src="billiken.png">
      <p>
      You may load this file in MATLAB using the command
      <pre>
      A = imread('billiken.png');
      </pre>
      The returned array&nbsp;<tt>A</tt> is a three-dimensional array
      of size 202-by-320-by-3, where entry <tt>A(r,c,:)</tt> is a
      vector of length three with the corresponding red, green and
      blue values (integers from 0 to 255).
