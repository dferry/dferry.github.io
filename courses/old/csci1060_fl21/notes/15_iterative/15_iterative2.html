Code for Iterative Solver
</H2>

<HR>

<p>
In our <a href="./15_iterative.html">previous lecture</a> we introduced the
general concept of an iterative solver, and then demonstrated code
using this technique for computing a square root.  We would like to
demonstrate how the same approach can be used for the gambler problem.
But rather than develop the entire code base from scratch, we would
like to use a more general design framework.

As our first version, we suggest the following <tt>iterativeSolver</tt>
function.
<pre>
function soln = simpleIeterative(initial, updateFunc, params)
    error = 1e-10;
    soln = initial;
    solved = false;
    while ~solved
        prev = soln;
        soln = updateFunc(prev, params);
        solved = all(abs(soln-prev) &lt;= error);
    end
</pre>
Here, we assume that <tt>initial</tt> is an array that represents the
initial guess, that <tt>updateFunc</tt> is a function handle
representing the function that is able to use one guess to
create the subsequent guess, and that <tt>params</tt> is used to hold
information that may need to be passed to <tt>updateFunc</tt>.


<h3>function handles</h3>

<p>
In MATLAB, sometimes one function needs to be given access to another
function as a runtime parameter.  This is done by passing a "handle"
to one function as a parameter to another.  Syntactically, the
<tt>@</tt>&nbsp;character is used to create a function handle.  For
example, the expression <tt>@sum</tt> is a handle to the built-in
function <tt>sum</tt>.

<h3>square root example</h3>

<p>
As a simple example, here is an m-file that uses our iterative solver
to compute square roots.

<pre>
function x = simpleSqrt(n)
    guess = 1;
    x = simpleIterative(guess, @newtonUpdate, n);

function val = newtonUpdate(x, n)
    val = (x + n/x) / 2;
</pre>

The <tt>newtonUpdate</tt> function uses Newton's method to compute a
better approximation for the square root by taking the average of
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>n/x</tt>.  A handle to this function is passed as a
parameter to the <tt>simpleIterative</tt> function.


<h3>more robust version</h3>
<p>
We offer a more robust version of our software named
<tt><a href="iterativeSolver.m">iterativeSolver.m</a></tt>.
This uses the same logic as our original version, but it allows for
more customization by the caller in monitoring the number of
iterations that are used as well as to see the intermediate results
within the main loop.  Those intermediate results are reported by
using a "callback" function as an extra parameter.  The callback is
similar to the update function, in that it is presumed to be a
function handler sent by the caller.   The this callback function can
be coded to do what we want, such as to generate plots of the
successive approximations.

<p>
As a further demonstration, we provide a more robust version of the
square root code, named <tt><a href="newSqrt.m">newSqrt.m</a></tt>,
that uses the new solver.


<h3>Revisiting the gambler problem</h3>

<p>
When computing the square root, the form of our solution was a scalar.
For the gambler problem, we wish to consider a solution that is a
vector representing key information for each possible bankroll from 0
to the goal. In this case, an update rule must construct a new vector
of values based on a previous vector.

<p>
As an example, if we are interested in knowing the chance of an
overall win, when starting at a given bankroll, our update function
can be written as follows.
<pre>
function new = winUpdate(old, p)
    new = zeros(1, length(old));
    new(1) = 0;                   % gambler loses with bankroll 0
    new(end) = 1;                 % gambler wins with bankroll goal
    for k = 2:(length(new)-1)
        new(k) = (1-p) * old(k-1) + p * old(k+1);
    end
</pre>
This logic is based on the analysis from <a href="./15_iterative.html">last
lecture</a>. To demonstrate this approach, with full animation of
itermediate results, download the file <tt><a
href="win.m">win.m</a></tt> and use it together with our robust
iterative solver.


<p>
If we want to compute the average number of bets for a given starting
bankroll, we only need to make a minor modification to the above
approach.  We write a <tt>betsUpdate</tt> function as follows.
<pre>
function new = betsUpdate(old, p)
    new = zeros(1, length(old));
    new(1) = 0;                     % no more betting with bankroll 0
    new(end) = 0;                   % no more betting with bankroll goal
    for k = 2:(length(new)-1)
        new(k) = 1 + (1-p) * old(k-1) + p * old(k+1);  % one bet plus more...
    end
</pre>
The full version of this program can be
download as the file <tt><a
href="bets.m">bets.m</a></tt>.

<p>
Finally, we offer a program <tt><a href="placed.m">placed.m</a></tt>
that computes how many bets would be expeced to be placed with each
intermediate bankroll, given a fixed goal and initial bankroll. Its
update rule is written as follows, expecting auxillary parameters to
designate the p value and the assumed starting bankroll.
<pre>
function new = placedUpdate(old, params)
    p = params(1);
    start = params(2);
    new = zeros(1, length(old));
    new(1) = 0;     % never places a bet with bankroll 0
    new(end) = 0;   % never places a bet with bankroll goal
    for k = 2:(length(new)-1)
        new(k) = p * old(k-1) + (1-p) * old(k+1); % must have recently won from index-1
    end                                           % or lost from index+1
    new(start) = new(start)+1;                    % initial bankroll gets one extra
