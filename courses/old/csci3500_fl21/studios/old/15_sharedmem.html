<p>Shared memory is a low level, fast, and powerful method for sharing data
between concurrently executing processes. This technique allows two separate
processes to read and write the same physical memory, providing an inter-process
programming paradigm that is very close to that of multi-threaded or parallel 
programming. </p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create fixed-size shared memory regions across processes
  <li>Implement a basic but robust concurrency protocol to manage concurrent
reads and writes
  <li>Clean up the shared memory regions safely
  <li>Benchmark shared memory speed
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Once constructed, the basic interface to a shared memory region is 
just a <code>void</code> pointer. Rather than working at this low level (and
in order to avoid the temptation for unsafe programming) we will start by
defining a structure that we will use to impose order. Our basic shared data
structure will be a constant-size array.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a header file
<li>Define a <code>char*</code> string that will serve as the name for your
shared memory region.
<li>Define a <code>#define</code> that holds the size of your shared array.
For testing, a size of around 10 should be sufficient.
<li>Declare a structure that will organize your shared data. In this case,
declare four fields:
<ul>
<li><code>volatile int write_guard</code>
<li><code>volatile int read_guard</code>
<li><code>volatile int delete_guard</code>
<li><code>volatile int data[shared_mem_size]</code>
</ul>
</ol>

<p><li>Our concurrency approach today will be to implement a master/slave
solution. We will assume that one process, called the master, is the one that
is always executed first and creates the shared memory region. Otherwise, we
would have to account for a concurrency race on which process creates and
sets up the region.</p>

<p>Create a new file called <code>master.c</code>. This file should create the
shared memory region with the following steps. General documentation for
Linux shared memory regions is found in <code>man 7 shm_overview</code>.

<ol>
<li>Create a shared memory file descriptor with <code>shm_open()</code>. You
should use the flags <code>O_RDWR | O_CREAT</code>, which specify that this
shared memory is read/write and that this call should create the region if it
does not already exist. 
<!--
For added protection, you may want to include
<code>O_EXCL</code>, which will generate an error if a region with the given
name already exists.
--> 
It is sufficient to use <code>S_IRWXU</code> for the
third parameter (which defines user permissions to the shared region).
<li>The previous step creates the shared memory region, but it is created with
a capacity of zero bytes. Use the function <code>ftruncate()</code> to resize
the memory region. Since we are organizing our shared memory via the struct
declared in your header file, set the size to be the <code>sizeof</code> this
struct.
<li>Now we need a way to read and write to the newly created region. Use
the <code>mmap()</code> function to map the shared memory into your program's
address space. The <code>addr</code> and <code>offset</code> fields should be
<code>NULL</code> and <code>0</code>, respectively. The permissions parameter
should specify both <code>PROT_READ</code> and <code>PROT_WRITE</code>, and the
flags parameter should specify that this is a shared mapping with
<code>MAP_SHARED</code>.
<li>Finally, we want to treat our shared memory region as though it were a
struct of the type declared in our header file. Create a struct pointer and
use it to cast the return value of <code>mmap()</code>. Now, you can read
and write your shared structure via this pointer.
</ol> 

<p>Define an array the same size as the <code>data[]</code> array in your
shared struct. In your program, use the <code>srand()</code> and
<code>rand()</code> functions to populate this
local array. Then, copy this array into the shared struct- either with the
<code>memcpy()</code> function, or though element-wise assignment. Have your
program print out the local array.</p>

<p><li>Make a copy of your master program named <code>slave.c</code>. This
program will gain access to the shared memory region in nearly the same way,
with two modifications. First, the call to <code>shm_open()</code> should
not specify <code>O_CREAT</code>. Second, the call to <code>ftruncate()</code>
is unnecessary, though keeping it (as long as you don't change the size of the
region) doesn't hurt anything. </p>

<p>Modify <code>slave.c</code> so that it prints the contents of the shared
data field. Build both programs, and then execute the master and slave
programs, in that order. Verify that the program output is identical. Copy
and paste the output of both programs as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>Right now
our processes are effectively acting like they are reading and writing a shared
file, but we would like them to share more dynamically. In particular, we want
our processes to react to events that occur in their partner. The desired
execution is as follows:

<ol>
<li>The master creates the shared memory region and waits for the slave to be
created.
<li>The slave is created, notifies the master to start writing, and waits for the data to be
written to the shared struct.
<li>The master writes the data to the struct, notifies the slave to start
reading, and waits for the slave to finish reading.
<li>The slave prints the data to the console, notifies the master that it is finished,
and unlinks itself.
<li>The master destroys the shared memory region. 
</ol>

<p>
The purpose of the other non-data fields in our shared struct is to
facilitate the waiting and notification of these events between processes. 
For example, in the sequence above the master must wait for the slave to
be created before it starts writing data into the shared region. The master
can wait on the value of the <code>write_guard</code> variable by spinning,

<p>
<code>while( shared_ptr-&gt;write_guard == 0 ){}</code>

<p>
and the slave can notify the master it is safe to proceed by modifying
the value,

<p>
<code>shared_ptr-&gt;write_guard = 1;</code>

<p>Modify your program to reflect the sequence of events given above,
using the <code>write_guard</code>, <code>read_guard</code>, and
<code>delete_guard</code> variables. Also, once it is safe to do so, the master
should remove the shared region with the function <code>shm_unlink()</code></p>

<p>
Note that
the shared memory region we created lives outside of either process
and persists when neither program is running (existing shared memory
regions can be found under the directory <code>/dev/shm/</code>). 
The above synchronization code relies on the fact that variables are intialized
to zero, which may not be true if your shared memory region is not properly
destroyed after being used. If you have inexplicable program bugs, you can
verify that this is not the issue by manually checking and deleting your shared
memory region in the above directory.
</p>

<p><li>Once you are convinced that your concurrency protocol is working,
modify the slave so that, rather than printing the contents of the shared
structure to the console, you simply copy the shared data into a local
array. With the protocol described above, the slave process lives just
long enough for the master to write data into the shared array and for the
slave to copy data out of the shared array. That is, the lifetime of the
slave process is approximately one complete transfer of data through
shared memory. </p>

<p>Use the <code>time</code> command with the slave program to
obtain a rough estimate of the <i>bandwidth</i> through shared memory,
in bytes per second. Take measurements where the shared array size is
one million integers, ten million integers, and one-hundred million integers.</p>

<p>As the answer to this problem, report your recorded values.</p>

<p><h2>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h2></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Shared memory has a reputation for being fast, but that's not necessarily
always the case. For example, when typical reads and writes are much smaller
than the size of a page (4 kilobytes), or when memory is heavily loaded,
this method is known to not perform as well as some others (such as pipes) due
to paging overhead. Try benchmarking pipes and sockets versus shared memory
for a specific access pattern and see which method is actually fastest!</p>
