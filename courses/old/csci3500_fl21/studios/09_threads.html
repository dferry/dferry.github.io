<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Open up the manual page for <code>pthread_create()</code>. The third
parameter to this function specifies a new thread's <i>entry point</i>- the
location at which the new thread begins execution.This parameter will look a little unusual, because it's a special data type
called a <i>function pointer</i>. The function pointer type is given as:</p>

<p><code> return_type (* function_name ) ( argument_types )</code></p>

<p>What is the return type and the expected arguments for the thread entry
function?</p>

<p><li>Create a new progam. Before writing your main function,
write a function called <code>thread_entry</code> with the signature
specified in the previous exercise. This function should print a message
and then return NULL. </p>


<p><li>Now write your <code>main()</code> function and make a call to the
function <code>pthread_create()</code>. For the time being, leave the
second and fourth parameters of this function <code>NULL</code>. Be sure to
check the return value for errors. Note that this function does not set
<code>errno</code> and you cannot use <code>perror()</code>.</p>

<p>After you make a call to <code>pthread_create()</code>, make a call
to <code>pthread_join()</code> to wait for the created thread to finish.
The first argument of this function needs the value from parameter one
of <code>pthread_create()</code>. The second argument of this function
can be left NULL.</p>

<p>In order to compile your program you will need to add the
<code>-pthread</code> option to GCC. Copy and paste your program output.</p>

<p><li>Now you can create and run code inside a thread, but this really
isn't useful unless you can communicate with the thread. There are a variety
of ways to pass data between threads, but we will use a specific method
called <code>void*</code> passing. To do this we need to define a
<code>struct</code>, which is a collection of variables that are grouped
together. The syntax for defining a struct is as follows:</code>

<p><code>struct struct_name{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arg1_type arg1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arg2_type arg2;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;argN_type argN;<br>
};</code></p>

<p>And you can then declare a struct for use in your program such:</p>

<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;struct struct_name variable_name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;variable_name.arg1 = value1; //direct access<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;variable_name.arg2 = value2; //direct access<br>
</code></p>

<p>Keep in mind that you can also access the values of this
struct through a pointer to the structure as well. This will be
important in your thread entry function:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;struct struct_name *struct_ptr = &amp;variable_name;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;struct_ptr-&gt;arg1 = value1; //pointer access<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;struct_ptr-&gt;arg2 = value2; //pointer access<br></code></p>

<p>Define a struct with three members: an integer called <code>arg1</code>,
a character buffer called <code>arg2</code>, and another integer called 
<code>ret</code>. Copy and paste your struct definition.</p>

<p><li>Now create a struct in your main program and fill it with values.
Your thread can access this struct by passing a pointer through the
fourth argument of <code>pthread_create()</code>. Create a pointer to your
struct as illustrated in the last exercise and do so.</p>

<p>A pointer given to the <code>pthread_create()</code> function in
this way will be available to your thread entry function as the
<code>void*</code> parameter. However, the compiler doesn't know how to
access the data pointed to by a <code>void*</code> pointer. 
To access the data inside the
struct we need to <i>cast</i> the pointer type back to a struct
pointer, as so:</p>

<p><code>void* thread_entry( void* args ){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;struct struct_name* arg_ptr = (struct struct_name*) args;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("thread arg1: %d\n", arg_ptr-&gt;arg1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("thread arg2: %s\n", arg_ptr-&gt;arg2);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Print out the values of your struct arguments in the newly created
thread. Copy and paste the program output.</p>

<p><li>Now use the same structure to return a value to the <code>main()</code>
function. Write a value to the third member of your structure somewhere in
your thread, and then read that value in <code>main()</code> function after
you have executed <code>pthread_join()</code>.</p>

<p><li>Finally, parameterize your program to create N threads. This means you
will need to create an array of N <code>pthread_t</code> identifiers, 
and an array
of N <code>struct struct_name</code> structures to pass arguments. Then,
call <code>pthread_create()</code> for N iterations, and then
<code>pthread_join()</code> for N iterations.</p>

<p>You can easily write multiple, different strings to each thread using
the <code>snprintf()</code> function, which works just like the
<code>printf()</code> function. For example:</code>

<p><code>unsigned bufSize = 100;<br>
struct struct_name args[num_threads];<br>
for( i = 0; i &lt; num_threads; i++ ){<br>
	snprintf(args[i].arg2, bufSize, "This is thread %d", i);
}</code></p>

<p>Copy and paste your program output for five threads when you have
finished.</p>

<p><li>Run your prgram (with five threads) several times. What do you
notice about the output ordering? Why do you think this is?</p>

</ol>
