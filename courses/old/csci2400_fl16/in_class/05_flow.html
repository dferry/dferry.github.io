<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 2400: Assembly Class 5<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conditionals and Flow Control</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Any but the most trivial programs require flow control to control <i>how</i>
code executes. In assembly this is accomplished through the use of
<i>conditional jumps</i> that select code to execute based on the status of the
processor flags from the previous class.
</p>

<p>In today's class you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use conditional test instructions such as <code>cmpl</code> and <code>testl</code>
<li>Use conditional branches such as <code>je</code>, <code>jne</code>, and more
<li>Write a function that compares two integers with an if/then/else flow.
<li>Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 100.
</ol>

<p><h3>Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Login to hopper.slu.edu- remember you can login with:

<p><code>ssh username@hopper.slu.edu</code></p>

<p><li>Now, download a new program for today's class:</p>

<p><code>wget http://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/csci2400/asm/flow.s</code></p>

<p>In order to create conditionally executed code, we first have to understand
how program execution can be modified. Assembly programming doesn't have high-level
constructs like if-else statements or for loops. The only tool available to modify
the way a program executes is <i>jumps</i>, which would be considered <i>goto</i>
statements in higher level languages.</p>

<p>To use a jump, you need to define a jump target (or label). For example,
consider the following simple program:</p>

<p><pre>
main:
	pushl	%ebp
	movl	%esp, 	%ebp

	movl	$0,	%eax
target:
	call 	print_eax
	incl	%eax
	jmp target

	leave
	ret
</pre></p>

<p>This program starts executing at the start of main, and continues executing
through the <code>target:</code> statement. That <code>target:</code> statement
does not affect execution at all- it simply gives us a way to refer to that specific
section of code. Thus, the program skips directly from executing the <code>movl</code>
instruction to executing the <code>call</code> instruction. However, when the program
later gets to the <code>jmp</code> instruction, the program then jumps back up to the
<code>target:</code> line and begins executing again from there.</p>

<p><li>How many times does the jump instruction execute in this program?</p>

<p><li>What is the output of this program?</p>
		
<p><li>Make your own infinite loop program using the code above and run it. You
can kill the program in Linux using the key combination CTRL+C</p>

<p><li>Our first conditional instruction is the compare instruction:

<p><code>cmpl b, a</code></p>

<p>This is a useful all-purpose instruction for comparing two
signed or unsigned integers. Under the hood, this instruction computes the
result of a - b without storing the result. Then, If a == b then ZF is set to 1.   
If a &lt; b then SF is set to 1, and if b &lt; a then SF is set to 0.</p>

<p>Write a short bit of code to test all three situtations where operand A is
less than, equal to, or greater than operand B. Use the <code>print_all</code>
function to confirm your results.</p>

<p><li>Putting the previous exercises together, we can execute <i>conditional jumps</i>
based on the state of the processor's flags. These jumps are designed to work with
the comparison instructions. For example, the instruction <code>je</code>
is a <i>jump if equal</i> instruction. In the following code the program will
jump to <code>label_1</code> if the contents of EAX and EBX are equal.</p>

<p><pre>
cmpl	%eax,	%ebx
je	label_1
js	label_2

#execute section 3
jmp next

label_1:
#execute section 1
jmp next

label_2:
#execute section 2

next:
#continue executing

</pre></p>

<p>What C-style construct does the above code correspond to? Write a bit of
pseudocode giving the high-level behavior of this program. Ask the instructor
if you're unsure about the operation.</p>

<p><li>At the top of the program is a mostly empty function called
<code>compare</code>. Finish writing this function so that, when called,
it prints the message:</p>

<p><code>Testing A=%d and B=%d</code></p>

<p>Followed by one of the messages:</p>

<p><code>A is greater than B<br>
B is greater than A<br>
the arguments are equal</code></p>

<p>as is appropriate.</p>

<p><li>Test your function by calling it multiple times such that it generates
at least one of each result message.</p>

<p><li>The <code>testl b, a</code> instruction is also used to compare values. This
instruction computes the bitwise-AND of operand A and operand B. If this value is
zero then it sets ZF to one, and otherwise ZF to zero. You can then use the
<code>jz</code> (jump if zero) and <code>jnz</code> (jump if not zero) instructions
to control your program.</p>

<p>One special use of <code>testl</code> is as a loop index. The instruction</p>

<p><code>testl	%eax, 	%eax</code></p>

<p>will set the zero flag only if the register %eax is zero. Use the <code>testl</code>,
<code>decl</code>, and <code>jz</code> instructions to create a loop that prints the values from 100 to
1 in order from highest to lowest. Feel free to use a function such as <code>print_eax</code>
to accomplish this.


<p><li>Email your program to the instructor when you are done.
Include your answers to each question in your email
or in a text file and include them with your submission. These will count for
credit as a homework assignment.</p>
