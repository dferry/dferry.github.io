<h2 style="text-align: center;">CSCI 3500: Studio 7<br></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Pipes</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Pipes are a basic but fundamental method of inter-process communication.
They allow processes to communicate with each other as though they were
reading and writing to a shared file, when in fact they're accessing a
special mechanism provided by the operating system. Along with the system call
<code>dup2()</code> they permit the seamless redirection of program input and
output.</p>


<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a pipe using the <code>pipe()</code> system call
<li>Redirect file streams usin the <code>dup2()</code> system call
<li>Connect unrelated child processes through the use of pipes
</ol>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p>The <b>real</b> power of pipes lies in their ability to connect unrelated
processes, <i>even if the original programmers didn't intend that</i>! In order
to explore pipes today, we will need two simple programs.</p>

<p>Program 1: Write a short program that:
<ol>
<li>Prints a string to standard output and then returns.
</ol></p>
<p><i>Hint! This was the goal of Studio 1!</i></p>

<p>Program 2: Write a short program that:
<ol>
<li>Inside an infinite loop:
<li>Gets an input string from standard input using the function <code>fgets()</code>
<li>If the return value of <code>fgets()</code> is NULL, then break
<li>Prints the user input back to the console with <code>printf("Program 2 got: %s\n", input)</code>
</ol></p>
<p><i>Hint! This was also the starting point for Studio 6! (minus the infinte loop)</i></p>

<p>When you execute program 1, it should print a string and return. When you 
execute program 2, it should repeatedly receive user input and print the user
input back to the console until you enter the end of file character (CTRL-D). 
Once finished, copy and paste these programs as the answer to this 
question.</p>

<p><li>Now, create a new program called <code>pipe.c</code>. This program
should <code>fork()</code> and <code>execvp()</code> two children. The first
child should <code>execvp()</code> your Program 1, and the second child should
<code>execvp()</code> your Program 2. Then the parent program should wait on
both children with <code>waitpid()</code>.</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> suppose your Program 1 is called <code>print</code>, the code
to call <code>execvp()</code> correctly follows. Make sure you understand each
part!</p>

<p><code>char* cmd = "./print";<br>
char* myargv[] = {"print", '\0'};<br>
int ret = execvp( cmd, myargv );<br>
if( ret == -1 ) perror("Error exec'ing print");</code><p>

<p>If your code is working correctly, then your program <code>pipe.c</code>
will never return. This is because the input program, Program 2, cannot
recieve any input and will never terminate. You can kill these programs with
CTRL-C. We will fix this problem eventually.</p>

<p>Copy and paste your program output as the answer to this exercise.</p>


<p><li>Now we will create a pipe to connect the two child processes. In the
parent, before the first call to <code>fork()</code>, make a call to
<code>pipe()</code>. This function accepts a single argument of type
<code>int fd[2]</code>.</p>

<p>Look at the manual page at <code>man 2 pipe</code>. Which element of
<code>fd[2]</code> contains the read end of the pipe after <code>pipe()</code>
successfully returns? Which elemnt contains the write end?</p>


<p><li>Our goal now is to write the output of Program 1 into the input of
Program 2. However, we don't
want to have to modify Program 1 or Program 2. The solution is to
<i>redirect</i> the <code>stdout</code> stream of Program 1 into the
write end of the pipe, and then redirect the read end of the pipe into the
<code>stdin</code> stream of Program 2. To do this we will use the system call
<code>dup2()</code>.</p>

<p>Open the manual page for this function with <code>man 2 dup2</code>. 
Unfortunately it can be confusing. Let's rephrase our objective in the language
of this manual page. We want to... 

<ol>
<li><i>close <code>STDOUT_FILENO</code> in Program 1, replacing it with the write end of the pipe</i>
<li><i>close <code>STDIN_FILENO</code> in Program 2, replacing it with the read end of the pipe</i>
</ol></p>

<p>The function <code>dup2()</code> takes two arguments. Which argument is <i>closed</i>
when the function succeeds?</p>

<p><li>Now use the <code>dup2()</code> function in the manner described in the
previous exercise. Insert the call to <code>dup2()</code> after 
forking the first child, but before executing your Program 1. Replace the
<code>STDOUT_FILENO</code> descriptor with the write end of the pipe.
Similarly, replace 
<code>STDIN_FILENO</code> with the read end of the pipe in your second child.
Copy and paste your <code>dup2()</code> code.</p>



<p><li>Now execute your <code>pipe.c</code> program. The output of your
Program 1 should be read in by your Program 2, and then re-printed with the
Program 2 preface. For example, your output might read:</p>

<p><code>Program 2 got: Program 1 output line</code></p>

<p>Note that your program still shouldn't terminate. This is because your
parent program (<code>pipe.c</code>) is <code>waitpid()</code>-ing on the
second child, and the second child still does not terminate. Use the
CTRL-C shortcut to kill your processes.

<p>Copy and paste your program output as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>The reason your Program 2 does not terminate is because it will
continually check the read end of your pipe for more data as long as the write
end of the pipe is still open. Once all of the write ends of the pipe have
been closed the pipe will deliver an end-of-file notification, letting the
reader(s) know that no further data will be coming.</p>

<p>Use the <code>close()</code> system call to tidy up your access to the
pipe. Remember that three processes now have access: the parent and the
two children. Your parent is not reading or writing the pipe, so it should
close both the read and write ends. Your Program 1 child does not need to
read from the pipe, so it should close the read end. Your Program 2 child
does not need to write to the pipe, so it should close the write end.</p>

<p>Once the above steps are complete, the <code>pipe.c</code> should execute
and then terminate correctly. Copy and paste your output.</p>

<p><li>If you think about it, you just achieved a pretty impressive feat.
You just shared data between two programs who had no idea that each other
existed. In fact, your programs have no idea where their data comes from, 
and no idea where it goes. They simply read and write to file streams,
and the operating system can redirect these file streams at will. For all they
know they could be acting on an actual file, a virtual file, a network
socket, or any other suitable I/O channel, and the operating system 
seamlessly does all the heavy lifting in the background. Give two advantages
to this stream ambiguity.</p>
