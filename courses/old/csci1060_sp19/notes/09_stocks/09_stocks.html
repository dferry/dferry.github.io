Notes 09: Analyzing Stock Market Data with Control Flow
</H2>


<hr>

<p>The <a href="djia.txt">stock market data</a> first seen in 
Homework 3 is a trove of information,
and it will form the basis for Homework 4 as well. Today we will
perform a few data analysis tasks in MATLAB:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the largest single day gain
<li>Find the largest single day loss
<li>Find the largest single day percentage gain
<li>Find the total number of days of gain, loss, and no change
<li>Compute the average gain and loss per day
</ul>

<p>The second day's code from in class can be downloaded here: <a href="moredow.m">moredow.m</a></p>
