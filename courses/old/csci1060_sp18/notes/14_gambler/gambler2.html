The Gambler

<p>
As a followup to <a href="gambler.html">the previous lecture</a>, we
reexamine the gambler model. 
Using the <a href="gambler.m">previous solution</a> we would like
to take this a few steps further.

<ul>
  <li>
      To produce graphs such as those given in the previous lecture
      notes, comparing the chance of success and average number of
      bets to the starting bankroll. Here is an example showing the
      statistics for last classes challenge of goal=100, p=0.49.

  </li>
  <li>
      To produce graphs that plot the success percentage and
      average number of bets relative to the probability.
      <br>

  </li>
  <li>
      Although we already track the average number of steps for a
      given trial, we wish to update our code in order to compile
      statistics, for each possible bankroll value, of how many steps
      begin with that bankroll.
  </li>
  <li>
      To animate a single trial showing the current bankroll along the
      way, as well as a summary of what percentage of time was spent
      with each intermediate bankroll.
  </li>
</ul>


<!--
<p>
As a step in this direction, here is an 
<a href="fancy/gambler.m">updated version</a> of the gambler.m file
that provide an animation of the process when trials==1, and which can
track the number of steps spent at each individual bankroll.
