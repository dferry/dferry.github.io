<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Time to put it all together! In today's class you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Process an array of data looking for specific values
<li>Find the max of the array
<li>Find the min of the array
<li>Find the position of a special target value
</ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Login to hopper.slu.edu- remember you can login with:

<p><code>ssh username@hopper.slu.edu</code></p>

<p><li>Now, download a new program for today's class:</p>

<p><code>wget http://cs.slu.edu/~dferry/courses/csci2400/asm/array.s</code></p>

<p><li>Scroll to the bottom of today's program. You will see 500
data values labeled <code>array</code>. Your goal is to write a
program that processes this array doing three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the maximum value
<li>Find the minimum value
<li>Find the position of a specific value, 615049950 (this value is stored in the variable <code>target</code>)
</ol>

<p>It should then print these values at the end of the program.</p>

<p>Hints:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can move the starting address of the array into a register with the instruction: <code>leal array, %edx</code>
<li>Suppose you have the array base stored in EDX and a counter stored in ECX. Then you can use <i>scaled indexed</i> accessing to iterate through the array: (%edx, %ecx, 4)
<li>Feel free to declare new variables to hold things such as the max and the min values
<li>Start by tackling each of the three tasks separately, then integrate them together
<li>You may find it useful to encapsulate some program functionality inside separate procedures, though you don't have to
</ul>

<p><li>When you are done with all of the in-class programming assignments, email them to
dferry_submit@slu.edu. 
Include your answers to each question in your email,
in a text file, or in program comments and include them with your submission. These will count for
credit as your participation grade.</p>
</ol>
