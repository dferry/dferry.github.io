    <a name="project0">Graphical Modeling of Biological Systems in Education</a>
    </h3>
<p>
Students in introductory biology courses must demonstrate their
understanding of biological systems by developing graphical models of
such systems (e.g., food chains, signaling pathways, metabolic
networks). This web-based system will support students' creation and
revision of such diagrams, will support the course staff in reviewing
the diagrams and providing embedded feedback, and will provide
analytics that might support educational research.

    <h3>
    <a name="project1">Monitoring Patients' Cardiovascular Health via Common
    Wearable Fitness Devices</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The goal is to develop a system that allows for medical remote
evaluation of patients using biometric data (e.g. heart rate,
activity, sleep) from existing commercially available wearable devices
(e.g., a Fitbit). The system will rely upon a patient's mobile phone
for the communication link from the device to the remote electronic
medical records, and will allow physicians to remotely monitor and
communicate with patients. The system may also calculate additional
variables derived from the primary data such as variability of heart
rate and activity and to alert a physician to detection of critical levels.

    <h3>
    <a name="project2">Scalable Genome Assembler using Apache Spark on Cloud</a>
    </h3>
<p>
Genome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number
of DNA fragments and putting them back to create a
representation of the original chromosomes from which the DNA
originate. De novo genome assembler attempts to reconstruct
genomes from its genomic sequencing data without using reference
genomes. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing
technologies generate very large scale DNA fragments that
enhance the correctness of genome assembly, but those large
scale datasets are computationally expensive.
</p>
<p>
To cope with massive sequence data generated by next-generation
sequencing machines, a highly scalable and efficient parallel solution
for genome assembly is important. In this capstone project, we will
implement a scalable genome assembler using Apache Spark on
Cloud. Apache Spark is a cutting edge open-source cluster computing
framework for large-scale data processing. Apache Spark provides
GraphX API that is a distributed graph processing framework on top of
Spark. The GraphX enabled us to easily distribute a very large
overlapping graph into several virtual machines and process the big
graph. This very large-scale sequence analysis can be adapted not only
for genome assembly but also for many other scientific domains.

    <h3>
    <a name="project3">Mozilla Language Plugin</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The goal of this project is to create a Mozilla Firefox plugin
that will allow a user to highlight an unfamiliar word in order
to find the definition via JavaScript modal popup. The program
will be written mostly in JavaScript, but will likely employ CSS
for formatting purposes. Optimally, the plugin will be versatile
enough to allow a user to use the plugin with a dictionary
website/database of their choice. Once completed, the plugin
will be available for download at addons.mozilla.org.
</p>
<p>
A major challenge with this project is the issue of "stemming"
words. If a dictionary only recognizes the singular form of a word,
for example, it would be difficult to define a word such as "oxen," or
"geese." By the final version of this program, this plugin will be
able to define words in both English and Spanish.

    <a name="project4">Kaetzi Symbolic Storage and Identification System</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The project is to be a software system for the storage of symbolic languages,
codes, shorthands, etc.It will be designed and tested using my personal
symbolic shorthand code Kaetzi. The software will take a symbol input
(drawn with a mouse via writing tablet) and store it as private use data,
displayable with a font (i.e. an image, which consists of the symbol only,
without a background). The database of symbols is to be searchable by
keyword.

    <h3>
    <a name="project5">Detecting Common Spelling and Grammatical Errors by Mining
    Wikipedia Changelogs</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The goal is to mine the changelog history on Wikipedia and extract the
most frequent spelling and grammatical errors in three separate
languages. Then, (1) turn this into a proofing tool to avoid the same
errors in the future, and (2) analyze and publish the results to help
language teachers focus on the most common mistakes.
</p>
<p>
The first portion of the project will be project management and data
mining for changelogs. Unix tools and regex will most likely be used
to format these logs. The second part of the project will consist of
turning the results into usable correction tool for word
processing. This will be implemented with the OpenOffice API. The API
will allow for multiple suggestions for commonly misspelled words.

    <a name="project6">Study of Bus Stop Quality in St. Louis County</a>
    </h3>
<p>
A tool to examine bus routes in St. Louis County, overlaid on Google
maps, with imagery. The tool will also allow bus stop rating through a
checklist of essential traits the stop has. This tool will assist in
checking the quality of the stops, and be a foundation to persuade
improvement of bus stops from Metro organization.

    <h3>
    <a name="project7">On The Rails</a>
    </h3>
<p>
We will build a game of the first person "rail" shooter genre. In this
game, players will be kept on a guided path as they battle through
enemies. The game will require cooperation from two players, and the
players will interface with the game via gaming joysticks.
</p>
<p>
Unlike most first person shooters, this game will attempt to abstract
core elements of the genre so that our game does not simulate the
killing living beings. Thus, the enemies of the game will be drones,
and the environment of the game will be set in cyberspace. The artwork
for the game is inspired from the movie Tron Legacy, and thus, it will
feature of simple geometrical shapes with a color scheme that is
composed of black and bright neon colors.
</p>
<p>
The game will be built via the Unity Game engine, and we anticipate
that the code for the game will be written in C#. Furthermore, game
objects will be constructed using a 3D modeling software called
SketchUp.
</p>
<p>
In addition to building the software for the game, we will also be
constructing a physical shell for the game like most arcade
machines. The players will sit side by side in an encapsulation. A
computer will be housed inside the encapsulation, and it will be
tasked with running the game.

    <a name="project10">A Real-Time Survival-Defence Game</a>
    </h3>
<p>
This project targets the design and implementation of a survival-defense game
with Unity 3D.The game will be a third-person overhead combination of
levels and monster wave generation.The player will move around the map
and collect ammo, health, and currency while defending against a variety
of enemies with different attributes coming in wave pattern attacks. As
the levels progress, the waves become harder and harder, and it will be
the goal of the player to survive as long as possible. A good example of
such a game may be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq8pEH48JnY. My
game, while similar in fundamental nature, will contain significant
differences, including a full upgrade system allowing he player to collect
currency from slain creatures and spend it on upgrades between rounds in
order for them to survive higher levels. The game design and coding will
be done in Unity, while the models and textures will be done in Blender
and/or 3dsMax. Some models may be obtained from Unity Asset Store as well.
The target platform for the game will be the computer (PC and Mac)
initially, but I believe the nature of the game will port well to mobile
devices.

    <a name="project11">Workout</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The app is designed for users to have the ability to create
certain machines/equipment workout routines based on the
equipment available to them. (What's the point of looking up workout routines online with certain
machines/equipment if the user doesn't have that same equipment available
to them?) The app includes a database with tables including SLU equipment,
exercises, muscle groups, etc.

    <h3>
    <a name="project12">The Game Theory of Machine Scheduling</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The main purpose of this project is to better understand a machine scheduling
problem. Traditional competitive analysis for the problem can be viewed as
a two-player game, with one player releasing jobs to the second player who
chooses to schedule them among m machines. Viewing this problem as a game
allows us to use alpha-beta pruning to help analyze scheduling algorithms.
The first step is to create an alpha-beta pruning search algorithm in Java
that is generic for two-player games. This allows us to run alpha-beta
algorithm on different turn based games, such as Tic Tac Toe. Once the
search algorithm is implemented, we can use it on the scheduling problem
game to analyze scheduling algorithms. The next step will be to create the
rules of the scheduling game to run the alpha-bete pruning search
algorithm on it. We view the game as two players that take turns, one
assigns jobs to be scheduled and the other schedules the assigned jobs.
Once we are finished with creating the rulesfor the scheduling problem
game, we can use the generic alpha-beta pruning search algorithm to
analyze algorithms. We use a competitive ratio, which is the number of
jobs the optimal solution can assign divided by the number of jobs the
scheduling algorithm actually assigned. The point of the game is to have
one player assign jobs to force the largest possible competitive ratio,
while the other schedules jobs to get the smallest possible competitive
ratio. The alpha-beta pruning search algorithm allows us to search for the
lowest possible competitive ratio possible to analyze the algorithms.

    <a name="project13">Taiwanese Student Association Website</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The purpose of this project will be to construct an interactive web interface
for the Taiwanese Student Association to manage its members as well as
providing an interactive portal tailored for members and the e-board. The
front end of the project will be driven by a web interface using HTML5
with Javascript/JQuery. The front end design of the project will optimize
usability for members and have an intuitive flow that allows users to
navigate through to quickly find information about the organization. The
back-end will include a database that will store information such as
users, which will consist of members, non-members, and e-board, as well as
events. It will be implemented using MySQL or some other SQL based
database tool. Together, it will provide a complete infrastructure for
member interaction, as well as being a way for TSA to interact with its
members. It will also help to publicize our student organization in a more
effective way.

    <h3>
    <a name="project14">CodeBots: A Programmable BattleBotsGame System</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to create a robot arena fighting game (in the
vein of Battlebots), but with an emphasis on making the robots user-
programmable. This would entail creation of a very simplistic programming
system, from which users could create their own programming modules for
controlling their bots. In essence, the underlying goal of the project is
to create a new avenue for kids and even adults to learn about programming
in a fun and interesting way. This is a new area of game software and
every addition could help. As the key aspect of this game is the
programmability of the bots, the primary focus of the game development
lies there. The desire is to create a simple programming language for
creating modules to control bots, and then a drag-and-drop system for
populating the bots with these modules. Should the drag-and-drop system
prove infeasible in the allotted time, a fallback approach of using drop-
down menus to select options is also perfectly acceptable. However, some
other game aspects are also needed to complete the game. These game
components may be done more simply:
- Implementation of an arena game map, to provide a setting for the
robot fighting
- Simple unit models for representing the bots
- A turn-based combat system sufficient to demonstrate the programmable
nature of the bots, and to demonstrate the different features of their
programmability.
This game will be built using one of the popular game engines, such as
Unity or Unreal Engine, to be selected as deemed appropriate by the
student.

<p>
The goal of this project is to create a Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) game using
the Unity game engine. The vision for the game is akin to the classic game
Risk, but with the addition of resource gathering and a monetary system.
Some of the specific aspects of the project needed for this strategy game
include:
- Enemy AI for controlling the computer-controlled players
- Implementation of one or more game maps, which indicate which players
control each of the regions
- A combat system for managing attempts by players to take other players
regions
- A game GUI for showing the game map and indicating the amount of
resources available to the player
- Tools for gathering, managing, and using a player's resources (such as
armies, gold/money, and gather able resources like wood, ore, etc.)

    <a name="project22">Segmentation and Analysis of Spinal Canal in CT Images</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The goal of the project is to design and implement an image segmentation and
structural analysis software toolset that will segment a series of
cervical spine CT images, identify the spinal canal, and measure the
structure of the spinal canal. Java and ImageJ will be used to implement
the toolset. Some of the specific aspects of the project needed for this
segmentation and analysis toolset include:
- Assess the segmentation performance of a variety of segmentation
algorithms in segmenting spinal CT images, and identify the most
capable algorithms for segmenting the spinal canal.
- Learn the ImageJ Java application toolset and library, and how new
applications of ImageJ are created as plug-ins to the main toolset.
- Implement one of the more effective segmentation algorithms in ImageJ.
- From the segmentation results, use line and/or curve detection on the
interior walls of the bones surrounding the spinal column, and connect
those lines/curves to form the boundary of the spinal canal.
- For each slice (single image) in a series of spinal CT images, compute
the spinal canal width at each point along the spine. From the
distribution over all slices, identify the expected spinal canal width.
- Provide a GUI that visualizes the segmentation results and highlights
the spinal canal.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: The project may assume the existence of sagittal spine CT images (i.e.
side-view slices of the spine). It is not a requirement that series of
transverse/axial (top-down view) or coronal (front-view) CT images be
converted to sagittal view (though students may wish to use such an
ImageJ plug-in, if such already exists).

    <a name="project24">Creating a GUI for CGMiner Setup and Monitoring</a>
    </h3>
<p>
The goal of the project is to create a GUI for the CGMiner tools, which is a
software suite for mining Bitcoin transactions. "Mining" - the process of
adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions
- is a difficult resource-intensive task, the purpose of which is to
enable the network to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus for each
of the transactions. It has been found that GPUs are particularly well
suited to the task of mining, and so CGMiner provides an open-source
software suite allowing any interested user to beging perform mining using
their AMD GPU card. The CGMiner tools are solely command-line driven
tools, and require considerable parameterization to appropriately install
and use. As such, the purpose of this project is to create a CGMiner
dashboard - a GUI allowing users to more easily setup and monitor their
mining with the CGMiner. This dashboard would provide a variety of
features for effectively setting up and controlling CGMiner, including a
setup and control panel and GPU temperature monitoring. The temperature
monitor would provide a graph of the GPU's temperatures over time,
including average and max temperatures of the graphics cards, and a
temperature shutoff should the GPU become too hot. The dashboard setup and
control panels would provide GUI controls both for initial setup and

The project goal is to perform a thorough design space analysis of a number of popular image segmentation algorithms. Such analysis first requires collecting image segmentation results over the full range of the parameter design space for a few popular image segmentation algorithms (e.g. Mean Shift, Normalized Min Cuts, etc). The segmentation resultswill then be analyzed by Prof. Fritts segmentation evaluation toolset, which quantitatively evaluates the qualify of the segmentation results using a variety of evaluation metrics. With the quantitative evaluation data, a software toolset will be developed that performs parameter space correlation and multivariate kernel density estimation to identify trends and data clusters that best characterize the algorithm's performance. While outside the scope of this project, this design space analysis will greatly facilitate unbiased selection of sample segmentations for use in subjective human studies on segmentation evaluation.'

    <a name="project54">Radar Processing Optimization Using Compressed Sensing</a>
    </h3>
<p>
Radar Signal processing is computationally difficult because of the
number of samples that must be taken to perform a FFT on the data. The
Nyquist-Shannon Theorem states that we must take 2B (B=highest
frequency in signal) samples to perfectly interpret the wave. This
ends up being very costly because high speed A/D converters and fast
DSP hardware is needed.  It turns out that radar signals tend to be
sparse. Using compressed sensing, we need far fewer samples to
reconstruct the wave.
</p>
<p>
This project is designed primarily for experimentation. I will create
software that can run simulations, then conduct experiments using that
software. The goal is to see how well traditional radar processing
compares to compressed sensing, especially when using degraded (noisy)
signals.
</p>
<p>
Compressed sensing is an exciting, new field in Computer Science.
While some of the principles have been known since the mid-20th
century, the field really developed in 2004. There has been some
research on compressed sensing with radar. However, it is still a
research project that depends on ideal conditions.  There is an
excellent description of Radar Compressed Sensing available at

The authors describe three problems that are currently holding back
the design of operational systems. In particular, "the signal recovery
algorithms must be able to handle real-world radar acquisition
scenarios with sufficient computational efficient and robust
performance for noisy data." This is the primary focus of my project:
testing the effectiveness of CS on noisy signals. This should provide

A parallel corpus is a database of document pairs where one document
is a translation of the other and the documents are "aligned" at some
level, usually sentences. Parallel corpora are used to train all
modern statistical machine translation systems. One approach to
creating parallel corpora is via web-crawling and a system which will
identify document pairs which are translations of each other from the
crawled documents.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this project is to create such a program. It will take two
text files as input and calculate the probability that the two files
are translations of each other. The translation program should be
language-independent. The program will function by using pairs of
known translations to form "word pairs" that will then be used in
texts that are not known to be translations of each other to calculate
the probability of the texts being translations of each other.

    </h3>
<p>
futuristic hovercraft racing game that will be single player and
have at least one AI opponent. The race track will be flat and have a
variety of turns and the game will use physics in order to make it
realistic and challenging. A level of power will be set and will be
decreased by a specific amount with each collision with another racer,
the track walls, or other obstacles. The game play will be similar to
the games F-Zero and Wipeout but will include all original models,
textures, animations, and concept design with graphics and user
interface controlled by the Irrlicht engine.
