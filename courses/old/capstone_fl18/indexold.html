</H2>



<p>
The Capstone Project serves as a
concluding achievement for graduating students, allowing them to apply knowledge that they have gained 
from the Computer Science curriculum toward a year-long
project. Formally, the project is completed as part of a two-semester
sequence of 2-credit courses: CSCI&nbsp;4961 (Capstone
Project&nbsp;I) and CSCI&nbsp;4962 (Capstone Project&nbsp;II).
</p>


<HR>
<H2>
<A name="outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</A>
</H2>

<p>
After successfully completing this course sequence, students will be able to:
<ol>
<li> Communicate with a client regarding project requirements and
  formally document the requirement specifications.</li>

<li> Develop a project design and plan, including reasonable timeline
  and effort estimates.</li>

<li> Design, implement and test a medium- to large-scale software
product which meets given requirements specifications.</li>

<li> Use a range of tools in support of the development of a
  team-based software product.</li>

<li> Effectively communicate with peers and supervisors in a
  technical setting.</li>

</ol>
</p>


<HR>
<H2>
<A name="roles">Roles</A>
</H2>

<p>
Key roles in the capstone course are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Student Team</b>
      <br>
      Each project is to be completed by a team of students; in rare
      situations, that team may consist of a single student.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Client</b>
      <br>
      For most projects there will be a clearly identified "Client"
      who originally proposed the project or is a potential end user
      of the result; the client may or may not be a CS faculty member.
      The client typically serves as a primary point-of-contact in shaping
      the desired specification for the eventual product and may
      provide feedback on development prototypes.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Supervisor</b>
      <br>
      Each project will have a "Supervisor" who is a CS faculty
      member that oversees the team's progress on the project.  The
      Supervisor may or may not be the instructor-of-record for the
      course, and may be the same person as the Client, in cases where
      the Client is already a CS faculty member. The supervisor and instructor are jointly
      responsible for evaluating student teams.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Instructor</b>
      <br>
      The instructor-of-record for the course is responsible for the
      administration of the course, assignment of teams, scheduling of presentations, and
      record-keeping involving grades.
      </p> 
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
The Supervisor and the Instructor will work together in grading the
performance of the teams. A non-CS Client may be consulted, but has no
formal responsibilities in regard to evaluation.
</p>



<HR>
<H2>
<A name="projects">Project Selection</A>
</H2>

<p>
At the onset of CSCI&nbsp;4961, the instructor will circulate a
<a class="inactive" href="projects.html">list of potential projects</a> to consider. These projects are often suggested by
CS faculty members based on research endeavors or educational tools,
are based on requests coming from members of the broader SLU
community, or in some cases from external community groups. Students
will also be afforded an opportunity to suggest project ideas for
consideration. Projects should have an appropriate scope for a
year-long sequence, having a richness in both aspects of design and use
of technology. <a href="general.html">Past examples of project descriptions will be provided</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the second week, individual students will be asked to
submit a <!--<a href="forms/preferences/">ranked list of preferences</a>--> ranked list of preferences for projects of interest, and
preferences regarding the composition of student teams. The
supervisors will make final determination of the teams and
their assignments to projects, while taking into consideration the
preferences submitted by students. Those assignments will be announced
by the end of the second week.
</p>

<p>
During the third week, each student team must develop a <a href="projectPlan/index.html">formal
Project Plan</a> that outlines the scope of the project, and the timeline for
major deliverables for both Capstone&nbsp;I and Capstone&nbsp;II. This plan
must be approved and signed by both the Supervisor and Instructor no
later than Friday, September&nbsp;14, 2018
 to be considered prompt.
</p>

<H2>
<a name="timeline">Project Timeline, Deliverables, Presentations</a>

<p>
Each project is unique, and teams may adopt one of a variety of 
project management styles. However, all teams must adhere to the following
checkpoints and timeline (details of which follow).

      <p>
      <b>Deliverables</b>
      <br>
      Given the wide range of projects, there is no one-size-fits-all
      definition for the deliverables, but as part of the initial
      project plan, the students and Supervisor should outline four major
      stages of the project that are to be achieved by the four
      checkpoints in our timeline (middle of first semester, end of
      first semester, middle of second semester, end of second semester).
      </p>
      <p>
      For teams following a traditional waterfall model, 
      likely checkpoints are as follows:
      <ul>
	<li>
	    </p>
	    Deliverable #1: Requirements Specification
	    <br>
	    A writen document that clearly define the goals of the
	    final product in terms of functionality, user interface,
	    resource usage, and other such factors. This document
	    should include a project overview, any necessary
	    background knowledge, and an enumeration of formal
	    requirements specification for the eventual product
	    (e.g.,&nbsp;"Requirement&nbsp;7b").
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    Deliverable #2: Design Document
	    <br>
	    A writen document that describes a detailed design for achieving the
	    formal requirements. A design document should
	    include a description of the major components, their interfaces
	    and how they interact to form the whole. 
	    Figures should be included for clarity, such as a UML diagram of
	    the software design or an ER-diagram for a database.
	    This document should also contain a discussion of any
	    third-party technologies or software packages that will be
	    used in meeting the project goals. Teams should demonstrate 
	    software prototypes showing that
	    they have already evaluated and familiarized themselves with
	    key technologies and design choices.
	    Finally, this document must include a proposed time-line for the
	    remainder of the project life cycle, making sure to include
	    specific sub-goals for the development, implementation, and
	    testing phases of the project.
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    Deliverable #3: Alpha Version
	    <br>
	    The alpha version of the project is a preliminary
	    implementation that includes all
	    <em>major</em> functionality of the final product, yet may lack some
	    advanced features, have a less polished interface, and contain
	    some known bugs.
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    Deliverable #4: Final Product
	    <br>
	    The final product must be submitted, including complete
	    source code, documentation for deployment and usage,
	    database schemas, analysis, and so on, as appropriate for
	    the project. 
	    </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      For teams following an agile development process, the
      deliverables are more naturally going to be a series of
      working products with increasing refinement.

      For teams exploring research-driven questions, the
      deliverables might be papers that describe the work and results.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Presentations</b>
      <br>
      The teams will make four presentations during the
      two-semester sequence, typically just after a recent deliverable
      was submitted.
      Each presentation will be scheduled with 20&nbsp;minutes
      for a formal presentation, followed by up to 10&nbsp;minutes of
      questions from faculty members in the audience.
      Teams should prepare <b>polished presentation materials</b> and
      for most projects include a <b>live demonstration</b> of the
      current state of a product.
      Teams should test the presentation and
      demonstrations in the designated classroom well in advance of the
      scheduled presentation.
      </p>

	Here is a sample <a href="handouts/rubric.pdf">project presentation rubric</a>.
	</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Weekly Reports</b>
      <br>
      Each team is responsible for presenting a brief progress report
      during most class periods. For Capstone&nbsp;I students, the first
      report will be on the third week of the semester; Capstone&nbsp;II
      teams will make their first report on the second week of the
      semester.
      </p>

      <p>

      Each weekly presentation should detail what was accomplished
      during the week <em>by each team member</em>, what challenges were
      encountered, and a plan for activities in the upcoming week.
      <em>Each team member must speak for herself or himself.</em>
      
      </p>

      <p>

      Please inform the instructor in advance if you need to miss the
      class meeting; up to two absences can be replaced with emailed
      weekly reports, but any absences beyond the first two will
      result in a grade penalty.

      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Team Self-Assessment</b>
      <br>
	For teams comprised of two or more students, each individual
	must complete and submit a <a href="teamAssessment.txt"><em>Team Self-Assessment Form</em></a>,
	detailing his or her perception of the contributions of each team
	member. This assessment is due to the instructor 
	after the final presentation each semester.

      </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<HR>
<H2>
<a name="repo">Repository for Project Artifacts</a>
</H2>

<p>
<b>All teams will be required to use the department git repositories for
all project artifacts (e.g., all deliverables, source
codes, presentation materials).</b> Both the instructor and supervisor
will be granted access to the repository from the beginning of the
project. An analysis of contributions to the repository
may be used as additional evidence of individuals' participation.
</p>

<HR>
<H2>
<a name="grading">Grading</a>
</H2>

<p>
Each semester of the capstone project is graded based
upon the performance during that semester. The evaluation of students'
artifacts and presentations will be made by a combination of the
Instructor and project Supervisor. The overall grade will be weighted
as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
      10% Weekly Reports (including Project Plan for Capstone&nbsp;I)
  </li>
  <li>
      20% Deliverable #1 (CSCI&nbsp;4961) or Deliverable #3 (CSCI&nbsp;4962)
  </li>
  <li>
      15% Midterm Presentation
  </li>
  <li>
      40% Deliverable #2 (CSCI&nbsp;4961) or Deliverable #4 (CSCI&nbsp;4962)
  </li>
  <li>
      15% Final Presentation
  </li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>
Letter grades will then be assigned based on the following formula.


<DL>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
      A.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
      A- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of
      B+ or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
      B or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
      B- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of
      C+ or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of
      C or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 67% will result in a grade of
      C- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
      D or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
      F.
  </DD>
</DL>

Although team members will typically receive similar grades, in
some cases the Instructor and Supervisor may consider the
relative contribution of individual team members in assigning
individual grades.
