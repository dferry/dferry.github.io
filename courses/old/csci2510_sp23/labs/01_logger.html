<p>Small programs typically display diagnostic information as standard output
while they are executing, but for larger and longer-lived systems this is insufficient.
Such systems may execute in many places simultaneously, so we must create some notion
of a global output stream that correlates all activities of a system.</p>

<p>However, there is necessarily a synchronization issue in this situation.
If multiple components all try to write or print to the same location
simultaneously, we are likely to end up with a garbled mess. In this lab
we will create a single software component whose responsibility it is to
create, maintain, and synchronize access to a durable log for the entire system.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use TcpListener and TcpStream to manage the communication between a server
  and multiple connected clients.</li>
  <li>Use non-blocking sockets to maintain connection to many connected clients
	  simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Use crates to implement a global configuration file.</li>
  <li>Use a Cargo <i>workspace</i> and <i>integration tests</i> to start maintaining
  a multiple Rust packages as part of a larger project.</li>
</ol>

<p><h3>Lab Format</h3></p>

<p>This is an individual assignment. Discussion with other students is
permitted, but sharing code is strictly prohibited.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Packages to Implement</h3></p>
<p><code>log_component</code> - a logging server that takes log messages via network connection
from multiple other components and writes them to a single file</p>
<p><code>send_log</code> - a public-facing library that allows other packages to send messages
to the logging server</p>

<p><h3>Key Concepts</h3></p>
<p><code>workspace</code> - multiple Rust projects that are developed, built, and tested together</p>
<p><code>crates</code> - Rust software libraries that are downloaded and incorporated automatically
via the Cargo build system</p>
<p><code>config</code> crate - a general purpose tool that allows for using text configuration files</p>
<p><code>slumcs</code> - SLU Multi-Component System - the medium scale system we are implementing in
this course as well as the name of the workspace we are creating in this lab</p>
<p><code>config.toml</code> - the global configuration file for all components of <code>slumcs</code></p>

<p><h3>send_log</h3></p>
<p>This component implements the public-facing interface of the logging system in <code>slumcs</code>.</p>
<p>Since this is our first interface, I have created it for you in the following file:
<a href="./lib_send_log.rs">lib.rs</a>.</p>
<p>Please do not add any additional public functions, type declarations, or variables.</p>
<p>An example of a file that uses this interface is here:
<a href="./use_send_log.rs">main.rs</a></p>

<p>Upon encountering any error, print a descriptive message and panic.</p>

<p><h3>log_component</h3></p>

<p>This component implements a logging server that accepts and manages multiple
simultaneous network connections from other components. Each connection is monitored for
messages, and when one is recieved, that message is written to a global logging
file. This is necessary for a distributed system, where it assumed that not all
components will be executing on the same machine.</p>

<p>Your code should not make any assumptions about, or place any limitations on,
the number of components that may be connected at once. Remember that each time
<code>TcpListener::accept()</code> returns, it returns a <code>TcpStream</code>
that corresponds to a new connection. The requirement to support multiple connected
clients means that your code will have to manage multiple <code>TcpStream</code>
objects at the same time. These can be stored in a suitable data structure
such as a list or a vector.</p>

<p>The specific problem of blocking arises when dealing with multiple <code>TcpStream</code>s.
Previously in studios we have used the functions <code>std::io::read()</code>
and <code>std::io::read_to_string()</code> to read from the the network. These
are <i>blocking</i> calls that cause the program to stop and wait until some
data is available to read. When we have two or more streams, the problem is that
we may be blocked and waiting on stream A while there exists data on stream B
that we are not handling. If data never arrives for stream A, then the program
is effectively dead and non-responsive.</p>

<p>The solution we will pursue in this assignment is to mark our <code>TcpStream</code>s
as <i>non-blocking</i>. This changes the behavior of read calls such that
they will always return immediately- if there is data to read then they will return
<code>Ok()</code> with the number of bytes they read. If there is no data to read
at that time then they will return an error of type <code>io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock</code>.
Such reads can also return regular errors, so you will need to distinguish
"real" errors from "benign" WouldBlock errors.</p>

<p>Whenever data is read from a <code>TcpStream</code>, we can simply write that same
data to the logging file specified in <code>config.toml</code>.</p>

<p>Upon encountering any error other than WouldBlock, print a descriptive message and 
panic.</p>

<p><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>

<p>Before getting started, you will need to construct a workspace for <code>slumcs</code>.
This is a set of projects that are both independent Rust projects and interconnected
parts of the same system. Create a directory <code>slumcs</code> in your Git
repository. Inside that directory, create a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file with
the following contents:</p>

<pre>
[workspace]

members = [
        "log_component",
        "send_log"
]
</pre>

<p>Then, you can create the two projects for this lab with the following cargo commands.
Note that the command for <code>send_log</code> is different, as this is our first
library project. You may get a warning when executing the first of these commands,
but it is just saying that it can't find the second project specified (because you
have not created it yet).</p>

<pre>
cargo new log_component
cargo new send_log --lib
</pre>

<p>Because <code>send_log</code> is a library instead of an executable project,
the default filename in <code>/send_log/src/</code> is <code>lib.rs</code> instead
of <code>main.rs</code></p>

<p>Then, inside each of those projects, we want to add the <code>config</code> crate
to our dependency list. This will cause it to be downloaded next time the project builds.
Note that the first time you build your project after adding the dependency will cause
the crate index to be downloaded, and this may take a while. Inside both new directories,
open the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and add the following line under
<code>[dependencies]</code>:

<pre>
config = "0.13.3"
</pre>

<p>In this case, the name <code>config</code> is the name of the crate we want, and
the number is just the current version number at the time of this writing. After both
dependencies have been added, go back to the <code>slumcs</code> directory and
run <code>cargo build</code> to verify that everything is working correctly. This
should automatically build both new projects, as well as downloading and building
the <code>config</code> crate and its dependencies.</p>

<p>Lastly, to use the <code>config</code> crate you should create a new file called
<code>config.toml</code> in the <code>slumcs</code> directory. (Note that this file
has nothing to do with Cargo- toml is a file extension and is not unique to Cargo.
Inside this file you should place the following contents, though you should change
the port number to some random number between 10000 and 65000:</p>

<pre>
log_ip = "127.0.0.1"
log_port = 23456
log_file = "systemlog.txt"
</pre>

<p>You can include the <code>config</code> crate with <code>use config::Config;</code>
(note the capitalization). Then, you can load and access the contents of the
<code>config.toml</code> file with the following code:</p>

<pre>
    let config_path = "../config.toml";

    let settings = match Config::builder()
        .add_source(config::File::with_name(config_path))
        .build() {
            Ok(x) =&gt; x,
            Err(x) =&gt; panic!("Could not open configuration file: {x}"),
        };

    let log_ip = settings.get_string("log_ip").unwrap();
    let log_port = settings.get_string("log_port").unwrap();
    let log_file = settings.get_string("log_file").unwrap();
</pre>

<p><h3>Testing</h3></p>

<p>Your code will be tested with the following file: 
<a href="./test_logger.rs">test_logger.rs</a></p> 

<p>In order to build and run this code, add a new <code>test_logger</code>
entry to your workspace. Then run <code>cargo new test_logger</code>
and add the following lines to the cargo dependencies:</p>

<pre>
send_log = { path = "../send_log" }
rand = "0.8"
</pre>

<p>Then, run the code with cargo run. Note that this program requires two arguments,
so "cargo run 5 10" would create 5 simultaneous connections that transfer ten
messages each.</p>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>
<p><ol>
	<li>You must use the interface I have specified for <code>send_log</code>,
		but you can structure <code>log_component</code> however you would
		like.</li>
	<li><code>log_component</code> needs to have a <code>main()</code> function
		and produce an executable. <code>send_log</code> is a library
		and does not produce an executable.</li>
	<li>When opening the log file, make sure to (1) create it if necessary and
		(2) open it in append mode so as to not overwrite existing data.</li>
	<li>The <code>log_component</code> will end up checking all connected clients
		in a loop of some kind- but you should use <code>thread::sleep</code>
		in that loop so that it is not running continuously at 100% CPU
		utilization.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind move semantics and ownership when you manage the lifetime
		of your <code>TcpStream</code> objects. Ultimately these should
		"live" on a dynamically resizable data structure such as a
		list or a vector.</li>
	<li>Make sure you set the <code>config</code> crate as a dependency in
		both the <code>send_log</code> and <code>log_component</code>
		projects. See the examples above for how to use the crate.</li>

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the name(s) of the people who
worked together on this lab.</p>

<p><li>This compression technique works well in some cases, and poorly in
others. Give an example of each.</p>

<p><li>The <i>compression ratio</i> can be computed as (size before compression)/(size after compression).
For example if the original file size is 20,000 bytes and the compressed size is
15,000 bytes then the compression ratio is 1.33. There are three files above of size
one million bytes each: 1mil_random, 1mil_weak_bias, and 1mil_strong_bias. Each of
these files contains the numbers 0-4 in random order, but the random file contains all numbers distrbuted
evenly, while the weak and strong bias files shift the distribution so that the lower number
values occur more often. For example, zero occurs about 20% of the time in the random
file, about 75% of the time in the weak bias file, and about 90% of the time in the
strong bias file.</p>

<p>Which file do you think will compress best? Compute the compression ratio for each file with a compression length of one.</p>

<p><li>The Bash shell includes the nifty command <code>time</code>, which records how
long a command runs. Record how long it takes to compress the file <code>test4</code>.
The syntax in this case is "<code>time ./rle test4 output 1 0</code>". 
This will report three measurements: real, user,
and sys. How long does your program take to run in real time? 

<p><li>Try the above command again but with a compression length of ten, how
long does your program take now? Which operations happen more or less
frequently now? Formulate a hypothesis as to the difference.</p>

<p><li>Indicate which, if any, extra credit exercises have you have attempted.</p>
</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>3% Extra Credit</b>: Download the slu_logo.bmp file above,
this is an uncompressed image file. Compress the file, then uncompress it. 
Verify that you can still open the
image in a photo viewer and that it is not distorted.</p>

<p>The compression algorithm you have implemented
is a form of lossless compression, meaning that the entire uncompressed
file can be reconstructed and no data is lost. This approach works well
for highly structured data with lots of repitition. This can happen
naturally in a case like slu_logo.bmp, where the whole image has just a
few colors and lots of large same-color regions. Compute the compression
ratio of your algorithm with slu_logo.bmp. Then, open the file in a
photo editor (such as Microsoft Paint, Photoshop, or GIMP) and save it
as a .png file (lossless compression) and a .jpg file (lossy compression).
Compute the compression ratio for each method.</p> 

<p><li><b>2% Extra Credit</b>: As it turns out, lossy compression can be far
more effective in some situations than lossless compression. Compression algorithm
researchers are very skilled at removing data that is virtually imperceptible.
Download <a href="lab1/uncompressed.bmp">this file</a> and compute the
compression ratio using your algorithm. Then, use a standard photo editor
from before to generate a losslessly compressed .png file and a lossily compressed 
.jpg file and compute their compression ratios. Inspect the files carefully,
are you able to discern a difference between the three?</p>
