<p>
One of the main goals of parallel programming is to increase the speed at which
computations execute. If we have two or four parallel processing cores to devote
to our computation, we would hope that it might run two or four times faster. This
is easiest on so-called "embarassingly parallel" workloads, where there is obvious
opportunity for massive parallelism. 
</p>

<p>
In this lab we will explore basic threaded programming by building a brute-force password
cracking program, and then accelerating it by assigning work to multiple threads.
Each password attempt is completely independent of every other password attempt, so
we can easily distribute this work across multiple threads.
</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>pbkdf2()</code> to guess password hashes
<li>Iterate over aribtrary length strings with characters from 'a' to 'z'
<li>Create and wait for threads in Rust with <code>thread::scope</code> and
<code>thread::spawn</code>
<li>Divide work between multiple parallel threads
</ol>

<p><h3>Lab Format</h3></p>

<p>This is an individual assignment. Discussion with other students is
permitted, but sharing code is strictly prohibited.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

<p><h3>Program to Implement</h3></p>
<p><code>crack</code> - a runnable file that takes a target password hash, and reverses
that hash by trying all possible passwords until the correct password is found. This
program accepts five <i>command line arguments</i>- a method for passing information
to your program that we haven't used bfore this. The program takes five parameters:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>keysize</b> - What size of password space to search, including all smaller password spaces as well. For example, for a value of '3', your program would search all passwords from 'a' to 'z', then 'aa' to 'zz', and finally 'aaa' to 'zzz'.</li>
<li><b>iterations</b> - The number of iterations used by the <code>pbkdf2()</code> function. More iterations is slower, and thus more resistant to brute forcing.</li>
<li><b>salt</b> - "Glued to the password" before hashing. This is not secret and does not increase the difficulty of attacking any one specific password, but does defend against precomputation attacks and multiple users picking the same password.</li>
<li><b>target</b> - The target password hash to match.</li>
<li><b>threads</b> - The number of threads to compute hashes with.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the interface below, you can run your program by passing arguments through
<code>cargo run</code>. For example:</p>

<pre>
cargo run -- 3 16 na 9f31a06f59e8310c7af9f0aa40113bcba456350e 1
</pre>

<p>The above command tries all passwords of length up to 3, with 16 iterations, salt 'na'
and checks which one matches the given hash, using one computation thread at any given time. 
It should print the password "cat".</p>

<p>In the interface file below, note that a function <code>crack()</code> is provided.
It is a very good idea to provide helper functions that are called by <code>crack()</code>,
but please do not change the <code>crack()</code> interface, as this will break the testing
code. Note that this function returns an <code>Option::&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is
useful in the case that the function fails to find any matching password. If a password
is found, your function should return <code>Some(password)</code>, but if no match
is found the function should return <code>None</code>.</p>

<p><h3>Key Concepts</h3></p>

<p>
In proper practice, user passwords are never stored on the system. Instead, a function
called a hash is applied to the password. This protects the users of the system from the
master password file being stolen, and also protects the system administrator from the
liability of having to store sensitive secrets. However, when a user wants to authenticate,
they pass their true password to the system, which is then hashed. If the new hash matches
the stored hash, the user is authenticated. This means the only place that the password ever
needs to be stored is in the users' head, preserving security!</p>

<p>
To make things harder
on crackers, hash functions also use a salt which it combines
with the password to create the hash. Some hashes, such as the one we are using,
allow a variable number of iterations to be used, where more iterations slows
down the hashing process and significantly increases the difficulty of cracking, while
not seriously slowing down legitimate authentication attempts. Schematically:</p>

<p><code>password + salt + iterations =&gt; pbkdf2() =&gt; hash</code></p>

<p>To crack a password, your program should repeatedly call <code>pbkdf2()</code> using all possible passwords built of up to
<code>keysize</code> lowercase alphabetic characters. For example, if the given <code>keysize</code> is
four then your program would iterate over all strings <code>'aaaa', 'aaab', 'aaac', ..., 'zzzz'</code>
looking for one that hashes to the given input. If a match is not found, it would also look through
all strings of length less than <code>keysize</code>.</p>

<p>
When a match to <code>target</code> is found, the program should print the cracked password
and exit immediately. If the entire space of passwords is searched with no
match, the program should exit with no output.
</p>


<p><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>

<p>Before getting started, you will want to create a <code>crack</code> package
and <code>hash_demo</code> package, and add them to your workspace for <code>slumcs</code>.
Inside the <code>slumcs</code> directory, your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file 
would have at least the following contents:</p>

<pre>
[workspace]

members = [
        "log_component",
        "send_log",
	"test_logger",
	"deadlock_detect",
	"crack",
	"hash_demo"
]
</pre>

<p>Then, you can create the project for this lab with the following cargo command.</p>

<pre>
cargo new crack
cargo new hash_demo
</pre>

<p>Copy and paste the following files into your new projects. The <code>crack_interface.rs</code>
should be pasted into your <code>slumcs/crack/src/main.rs</code> and 
<code>slumcs/hash_demo/src/main.rs</code> files. The first file gives the basic interface to 
<code>crack</code> and the second file is a little code to get you started with
<code>pbkdf2()</code> and also allows you to generate your own hashes.</p>

<ul>
<li><code><a href="crack_interface.rs">crack_interface.rs</a></code></li>
<li><code><a href="hash_demo.rs">hash_demo.rs</a></code></li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to add the following dependencies to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> files
in each project:</p>

<pre>
[dependencies]
pbkdf2 = "0.12.1"
sha2 = "0.10.6"
hex = "0.4"
</pre>

<p><h3>Generating Hashes</h3></p>

<p>After creating the <code>hash_demo</code> project as described above, you can run
this program with command line arguments similar to <code>crack</code>. This program
takes three arguments:

<ol>
<li><b>iterations</b> - a positive integer typically in the 1000-500,000 range, for our testing in this lab, I would use much lower values in the range of 16-128</li>
<li><b>salt</b> - the salt to use</li>
<li><b>password</b> - the password to hash</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
user@hopper:~/slumcs/hash_demo$ cargo run -- 2048 na apple
   Compiling hash_demo v0.1.0 (/home/dferry/csci2510/system/hash_demo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.18s
     Running `/home/dferry/csci2510/system/target/debug/hash_demo 2048 na apple`
Got password: 'apple', salt: 'na', and iterations: 2048
hash1: [cb, 44, e0, b0, 15, 0, e0, d2, a7, a2, 2a, 79, 75, 64, b7, 4d, 3a, c9, 33, da]
cb44e0b01500e0d2a7a22a797564b74d3ac933da
hash2: [cb, 44, e0, b0, 15, 0, e0, d2, a7, a2, 2a, 79, 75, 64, b7, 4d, 3a, c9, 33, da]
cb44e0b01500e0d2a7a22a797564b74d3ac933da
</pre>

<p>This program computes the hash with two different functions with slightly different
interfaces, so it prints out hash1 and hash2 to prove that they're the same. This program
also includes a function <code>print_hex()</code> to print the contents of the hash
without spaces or commas in the way. The hash1 and hash2 lines print it out using
Rust's debug print, while the following lines are done with <code>print_hex()</code>

<p><h3>Testing</h3></p>

<p>As with the last lab, we can use <code>cargo test</code> to run a set of test
cases to verify the program is running correctly. However, there are two catches.
First, your program should print out the password when it finds it, so you want
test cases to produce output. Second, if you are testing parallel performance you
will only want to run the test framework with one thread at a time. You can still
create and use multiple threads inside each test case, but Cargo will only run
a single test case at a time. You can run your code in this fashion as such:</p>

<pre>
cargo test -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
</pre>

<p>You may also generate your own hashes and run your password cracker manually,
which may be easier while testing and debugging. Do this by running
<code>crack</code> with the "cargo run" form above.</p>

<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>

<p>
Start by writing a short program that uses <code>pbkdf2()</code> to encrypt a
given password and salt.
</p>

<p>
You should not make any assumptions about the maximum allowed keysize. 
</p>

<p>Writing a function to iterate over all passwords 'aaa' to 'zzz' is tricker
that it might first seem. Start by writing a program that simply prints all
strings of a given keysize.</p>

<p>After you have a function that iterates over all passwords, insert the
hash function and check against the target hash. You now have a single-threaded
password cracker.</p>

<p>Only after having a complete single-threaded password cracker should you think
about adding threads. This will require some refactoring, but it is significantly
easier overall than trying to write your multi-threaded cracker outright.</p>

<p>One basic problem in threading is deciding how work is assigned. We are looking
for reasonable speedup in this lab, but we don't need perfect speedup. A simple
work division strategy is to split the password space evenly by the starting character.
For example, if threads=2, then the first thread could check all passwords from
'aaa' to 'mzz', and the second thread could check 'naa' to 'zzz'. If threads=3, then
the first thread could cover a through i, the second thread could do j through r,
and the third thread could do s through z.</p>

<p>A more precise division strategy exists, which sounds complicated at first,
but really is not. Imagine the characters a to z as the numerals in a base-26
number system. If you are searching over keysize 4, then there are 26^4 total
possible passwords. If you are using two threads, then divide this value by
2 and use that as your division point. Then, convert that value to base-26
to get the starting password.</p>

<p>For example, 26^4 is 456,976. That value divided by two is 228,488. If we
convert that to base-26, then we get "naaa", or exactly what our thread division
strategy from above gives us. This makes sense, because two divides 26 with no remainder.
Then the first thread starts at "aaaa" and goes up to "naaa", while the second thread
starts at "naaa" and goes up through "zzzz". If we use three threads, then we divide
by three and convert to base-26, which gives us the base-10 number 152,325.333 repeating.
Rounding down, this gives starting points of 0; 152,325; and 304,650 for each thread,
corresponding to base-26 representations of "aaaa", "irir", and "riri".
</p>

<p>
You need to check passwords of length <code>keysize</code>, but don't forget you also need
to check the shorter ones. The simplest way is probably to write a function that
checks all passwords which are exactly a given length, and then have <code>crack()</code> call
it in a loop from 1 to <code>keysize</code>.
</p>

<!--
<p><h3>Hints</h3></p>
<p><ol>
	<li>You must use the interface I have specified for <code>send_log</code>,
		but you can structure <code>log_component</code> however you would
		like.</li>
	<li><code>log_component</code> needs to have a <code>main()</code> function
		and produce an executable. <code>send_log</code> is a library
		and does not produce an executable.</li>
	<li>When opening the log file, make sure to (1) create it if necessary and
		(2) open it in append mode so as to not overwrite existing data.</li>
	<li>The <code>log_component</code> will end up checking all connected clients
		in a loop of some kind- but you should use <code>thread::sleep</code>
		in that loop so that it is not running continuously at 100% CPU
		utilization.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind move semantics and ownership when you manage the lifetime
		of your <code>TcpStream</code> objects. Ultimately these should
		"live" on a dynamically resizable data structure such as a
		list or a vector.</li>
	<li>Make sure you set the <code>config</code> crate as a dependency in
		both the <code>send_log</code> and <code>log_component</code>
		projects. See the examples above for how to use the crate.</li>

<p><h3>Questions</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the name(s) of the people who
worked together on this lab.</p>

<p><li>This compression technique works well in some cases, and poorly in
others. Give an example of each.</p>

<p><li>The <i>compression ratio</i> can be computed as (size before compression)/(size after compression).
For example if the original file size is 20,000 bytes and the compressed size is
15,000 bytes then the compression ratio is 1.33. There are three files above of size
one million bytes each: 1mil_random, 1mil_weak_bias, and 1mil_strong_bias. Each of
these files contains the numbers 0-4 in random order, but the random file contains all numbers distrbuted
evenly, while the weak and strong bias files shift the distribution so that the lower number
values occur more often. For example, zero occurs about 20% of the time in the random
file, about 75% of the time in the weak bias file, and about 90% of the time in the
strong bias file.</p>

<p>Which file do you think will compress best? Compute the compression ratio for each file with a compression length of one.</p>

<p><li>The Bash shell includes the nifty command <code>time</code>, which records how
long a command runs. Record how long it takes to compress the file <code>test4</code>.
The syntax in this case is "<code>time ./rle test4 output 1 0</code>". 
This will report three measurements: real, user,
and sys. How long does your program take to run in real time? 

<p><li>Try the above command again but with a compression length of ten, how
long does your program take now? Which operations happen more or less
frequently now? Formulate a hypothesis as to the difference.</p>

<p><li>Indicate which, if any, extra credit exercises have you have attempted.</p>
</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>3% Extra Credit</b>: Download the slu_logo.bmp file above,
this is an uncompressed image file. Compress the file, then uncompress it. 
Verify that you can still open the
image in a photo viewer and that it is not distorted.</p>

<p>The compression algorithm you have implemented
is a form of lossless compression, meaning that the entire uncompressed
file can be reconstructed and no data is lost. This approach works well
for highly structured data with lots of repitition. This can happen
naturally in a case like slu_logo.bmp, where the whole image has just a
few colors and lots of large same-color regions. Compute the compression
ratio of your algorithm with slu_logo.bmp. Then, open the file in a
photo editor (such as Microsoft Paint, Photoshop, or GIMP) and save it
as a .png file (lossless compression) and a .jpg file (lossy compression).
Compute the compression ratio for each method.</p> 

<p><li><b>2% Extra Credit</b>: As it turns out, lossy compression can be far
more effective in some situations than lossless compression. Compression algorithm
researchers are very skilled at removing data that is virtually imperceptible.
Download <a href="lab1/uncompressed.bmp">this file</a> and compute the
compression ratio using your algorithm. Then, use a standard photo editor
from before to generate a losslessly compressed .png file and a lossily compressed 
.jpg file and compute their compression ratios. Inspect the files carefully,
are you able to discern a difference between the three?</p>
