<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Rust, variables are declared using the <code>let</code> keyword. </li>
	Try it with a statement like, "<code>let x = 10;</code>". Then, print the
	value of <code>x</code> with <code>println!()</code>.</p>

	<p>With <code>println!()</code>, you can print the value of a variable by
	enclosing it in curly braces:</p>

	<pre>
	println!("My value: {x}");
	</pre></li>

<li><p>Next, change the value of x with the line 
	<code>x = 20;</code> after your call to <code>println!()</code>. 
	Try to build and run your program- what happens? What does the 
	compiler error say? Copy and paste the compiler error as
	the answer to this question.</li></p>

<li><p>If we want a different value of <code>x</code>, one solution is
	is to use <i>variable shadowing</i>. Replace the line
	<code>x = 20;</code> with the line <code>let x = 20;</code>
	and then print the value of <code>x</code> again. Try to
	run your program now, what happens?</li></p>

<li><p>Why does this work? <code>x</code> is supposed to be an immutable,
	read-only variable. Why are we allowed to redefine <code>x</code>
	so that it takes a new value? Technically, we're not changing the
	value of <code>x</code>, we're creating a second variable that also
	has the name <code>x</code>. It might sound like we're splitting hairs, but
	we're not. A shadowed variable is equivalent to declaring two separate
	immutable variables, while any mutable variable is mutable. The compiler
	doesn't actually care about what name we give a variable- the compiler
	thinks of variables as the contents of a memory location.</p>

	<p>Shadowing an	immutable variable creates two separate variables in
	two separate memory locations. A single mutable variable creates a single
	variable in memory that changes.</p>

	<p>Try thinking up a situation where this distinction matters. In one program
	you have two immutable variables with the same name, in another program you have
	a single mutable variable. Be creative, and don't be afraid of being wrong-
	if you can't come up with a good example, ask the instructor or just take your
	best guess.</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's try creating a mutable variable, which is done with the <code>mut</code>
	keyword. Declare it as such: <code>let mut y = 20;</code>. Then, print the value
	of <code>y</code>, change the value, and print it again. Copy-paste your output
	as the answer to this exercise.</p></li>

<li><p>One more distinction to make clear- Rust also supports <i>constant</i> values that
are truly constant and never allowed to change. By convention, constant values are capitalized
in Rust. Try copy-pasting this code at the top of your program, above <code>main()</code>.</p>

	<pre>
	const TRIALS: u32 = 10000;
	const TRIALS: u32 = 20000;
	</pre>

	<p>What happens when you build and run this? Go ahead and remove one of the two definitions,
	and leave the answer to this question blank.</p></li>

<li><p>Rust variables also support data types. Rust is an <i>implicitly typed</i> language, which
	means the compiler will try to infer what data type to use, and most of the time it
	can get it right. However, you have the control to set an explicit data type, and it's a
	good idea to do so. This is done by putting a colon ":" after the name of the variable,
	and then placing the type after the colon.</p>

	<p>Look at the code below and make a prediction about what the output
	will be when the code runs. Then copy-paste this code into your program, run the code, 
	and record your reaction as the answer to this exercise.
	</p>

	<pre>
	let mut signed : i32 = 0;
	signed = signed - 1;
	println!("Signed result: {signed}");
	
	let mut unsigned : u32 = 0;
	unsigned = unsigned - 1;
	println!("Unsigned result: {unsigned}");
	</pre>
	</li>

<li><p>Go ahead and remove the code from the previous exercise. Leave this answer blank.</p></li>

<li><p>Last, let's write a benchmarking loop. Timing in Rust can be done with the <code>time</code>
	module. Copy and paste the following lines at the very top of your file.</p>

	<pre>
	use std::time::Duration;
	use std::time::Instant;
	</pre>

	<p>Then, copy and paste the following code inside your program :</p>

	<pre>
	let start = Instant::now();

	//Code to be benchmarked 
        
	let end = Instant::now();
        let runtime = end.duration_since(start);
	println!("Running time: {:?}", runtime);
	</pre>
</li>

<li><p>When running this code, you should get a printout of how long it took to run,
	and that time should be very quick. It is very likely measured in nanoseconds,
	or one billionth of a second. Write down how long it takes to run zero code.</p></li>

<li><p>There is actually some variation in how long code runs at this level. Copy and paste
	the above code three or four times. Run your program several times- do you notice
	anything unusual? For example, it is common that the first time a piece of timing
	code is invoked in a program, it may take a little longer to run. Discard any
	outliers and compute an average for the last measurement. This is essentially
	how long it takes to create a timestamp, and represents a lower-limit on what
	we can measure with this technique.</p></li>

<li><p>Now we will write a function and measure how long it takes. Outside of your
	<code>main()</code> function, write a function called <code>add()</code>
	which takes two integers and returns nothing. The signature should be:</p>

	<pre>
	fn add( a:i32, b:i32 ) {

	}
	</pre>

	<p>You can add <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> with <code>a+b</code>, but
	a single addition isn't enough to measure on its own. Write a for-loop around
	<code>a+b</code> using the <code>TRIALS</code> constant from before, and measure
	that. Once you have a good timing measurement for the <code>add()</code> function,
	divide that number by <code>TRIALS</code> to get a per-addition measurement.
</li>

<li><p>Does your per-addition measurement make sense? How many nanoseconds would you expect
	an add to take? Make an argument for or against why your number makes sense.</p></li>

<li><p>Try increasing the TRIALS value to see if your reported number changes. 
	On Hopper, I can go up to 10 million without too much of a delay.
	What happens? Why do you think that is?</p></li>

<li><p>Lastly, try timing how long it takes to execute a <code>println!()</code> statement.
	(Don't try doing this 10 million times- a handful is enough.) Write down what you
	printed and how long it took</p></li>

<li><p>Did any of these benchmarks surprise you? Why or why not? Write down one question you still
	have after finishing the exercises above.</p></li>

</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
	<p><li>std::time::Duration can be added together and operated on with multiplication
	and division. Try writing a for-loop that executes a snippet of code multiple times,
	discards the first five timings it gets, and for the rest it adds each computed
	std::time::Duration to a running total. Then at the end, divide the accumulated
	running total by the number of timings. This can be used to measure any operation
	a specified number of times- for example rather than having the <code>add()</code>
	function use a for-loop and iterate many times inside the function, you could just call the whole
	function multiple times.</li></p>

	<li><p>The terminal we use on Hopper has a built-in command called <code>time</code> which
		times how long a program runs. It produces output that looks like this:</p>

	<pre>
	real    0m3.140s
	user    0m2.915s
	sys     0m0.029s
	</pre>

	<p>What do you think "real", "user", and "sys", mean here? Try looking them up.</p>

	<p>You can even use this with <code>cargo run</code> by typing, "<code>time cargo run</code>". This is
	easy and convenient, and you can use it to time any program or command that runs on the
	terminal. Does it work for what we're attempting to do here? What are the pros and cons?</p>
	</li>
