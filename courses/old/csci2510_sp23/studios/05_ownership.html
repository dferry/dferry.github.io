<p>Language: Rust</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>One of the most unique features of rust is the concept of <i>ownership</i>.
		Traditionally, programming languages either did not enforce memory
		safety, such as in C and C++, or they took total control of memory
		allocation and deallocation, such as Python and Java. That dichotomy
		forced programmers to either accept the risk of memory errors, or
		give up fine-grained control of memory and consequently accept performance problems
		that come with that.</p>
		<p>Rust uses a third model, <i>ownership</i> that gives us the best
		of both worlds but also requires programmers to be explicit about how
		memory and data is allowed to be used in a program..</p>


<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Learn the ownership model of Rust</li>
	<li>Learn the difference between <i>copy</i>, <i>clone</i>, and <i>move</i> semantics in Rust</li>
	<li>Learn about <i>references</i> and <i>borrowing</i> in Rust</li>
</ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
For this studio, please create a new Rust project with the name 
<strong>ownership</strong> (note, case sensitive). 
As you work through these exercises, 
please record your answers in a text file in the root level of that
project. When finished, please add the entire project and push it
to the SLU Git repository.

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
	<li><p>When does a Rust object have to implement a <code>drop()</code> method?</p></li>
	<li><p>What is the difference between the Rust <code>copy()</code> and <code>clone()</code> methods?</p></li>
	<li><p>If you look up <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html">the documentation</a> for
		<code>u32</code>, it implements both the <code>copy()</code> and <code>clone()</code> methods.
		When would you want to have both methods, instead of forcing just one or the other?</p></li>
	<li><p>Which of the following statements is true?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All clones are copies.</li>
			<li>All copies are clones.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><p>Supposing that <code>Y</code> has type <code>String</code>, does the
		statement <code>X = Y</code> perform a copy, clone, or move?</p></li>
	<li><p>Supposing that <code>Y</code> has type <code>u32</code>, does the
		statement <code>X = Y</code> perform a copy, clone, or move?</p></li>
	<li><p>Supposing that array <code>Y</code> has type <code>[u32,12]</code>, does the
		statement <code>X = Y</code> perform a copy, clone, or move?</p></li>
	<li><p>Supposing that <code>Y</code> has type <code>Vec&gt;32&lt;</code>, does the
		statement <code>X = Y</code> perform a copy, clone, or move?</p></li>
	<li><p>Is the <code>clone()</code> method ever called automatically? If you don't know,
		take a look at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html">the documentation</a>.
		Why do you think the language designer made this decision?</p></li>
	<li><p>Why does the following code <i>fail</i> to compile? Try to identify the error on your
		own, but feel free to try and compile this code if you'd like. How should we fix
		this code?</p> 
		<pre>
fn main() {
    let mut greeting = String::from("Hello");
    let mut copy = greeting;

    greeting.push_str(", how are you?");
    copy.push_str(", world!");

    println!("{greeting}");
    println!("{copy}");
}
		</pre></li>

	<li><p>If <code>F</code> is a function, and <code>x</code> is an argument to that function,
		does calling the function <code>F(x)</code> perform a copy or move? 
		How do you know?</p></li>
	<li><p>In the code snippet below, which function ends up <i>owning</i> the variable <code>S</code>?
		In other words, where is the <code>drop()</code> method invoked on <code>S</code>?
		Five points are identified in the code below- identify at which point the variable
		<code>S</code> is dropped. Why is it dropped there?</p>
		<pre>
fn main(){

    let s = String::from("Hello, world!");
    //Point 1

    println!("Current value of S: {}", &amp;s);
    //Point 2

    modify(s);
    //Point 3

    println!("Goodbye.");
    //Point 4
}
//Point 5

fn modify( mut s1: String ){
    s1.push_str(" How are you?");
}
		</pre></li>

	<li><p>Why does the following code <i>fail</i> to compile? Try to identify the error on your
		own, but feel free to try and compile this code if you'd like. How should we fix it?</p> 
	<pre>
fn main() {
    let s = create_string();

    let b = check_for_world(s);

    println!("Does {s} contain 'world'? {b}");
}


fn create_string() -&gt; String {
    String::from("Hello, world!")
}

fn check_for_world( s1: String ) -&gt; bool {
    s1.contains("world")
}
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li><p>Does the following code fail to compile? Where is the variable <code>S</code> dropped?</p>
	<pre>
fn main() {

    let mut s = String::from("Hello, ");

    s.push_str("wor");
    s.push_str("ld!");

    println!("{s}");

}
	</pre>
	</li>	

	<li><p>How many simultaneous <i>non-mutable references</i> can you create to a variable in Rust? Why?</p></li>

	<li><p>How many simultaneous <i>mutable references</i> can you create to a variable in Rust? Why?</p></li>

	<li><p>Explain why the following code does not run:</p>
	<pre>
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &amp;mut s;
let r2 = &amp;mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li><p>Does the following code run? Why or why not?</p>
	<pre>
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &amp;mut s;
let r2 = &amp;mut s;

println!("{}", r2);
	</pre>
	</li>
