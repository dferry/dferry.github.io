<p>Language: Rust</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Examine the <code>match</code> syntax in Rust</li>
	<li>Open files for reading</li>
	<li>Print descriptive error messages with the <code>Result</code> type</li>
</ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
For this studio, please create a new Rust project with the name 
<strong>print_file</strong> (note, case sensitive). 
As you work through these exercises, 
please record your answers in a text file in the root level of that
project. When finished, please add the entire project and push it
to the SLU Git repository.

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Rust has a <i>pattern matching</i> system that makes writing certain kinds of
		code efficient and compact. It is most frequently compared to writing a
		train of if-else statements. For this first exercise, write a short Rust
		program that takes an <code>i32</code> integer, and prints one of the
		four statements {one, two, three, else} depending on whether the
		value of the integer is one, two, three, or any other value.</p></li>


	<li><p>Look up the documentation for <code>match</code> statements and write
		the equivalent program using the <code>match</code> syntax.</p></li>

	<li><p>Try looking back at your code for Studio 1, and in particular the code
		you wrote for handling the <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> that was
		returned from <code>stdio().read_line()</code>. Write a seqeuence
		of if/else statements, using the <code>result.is_ok()</code>
		and <code>result.is_err()</code> methods to distinguish a successful
		result from an error result. In either case, you should print an
		appropriate message that uses the data encoded in the result.</p>

		<p>Note that you can print an error object with Rust's built-in
		pretty printer that is specified by using "{:?}" in <code>println!()</code>
		rather than using "{}": <code>println!("Error: {:?}", result)</code></p>

		<p>The following code declares two result objects you can use to
		test your code. One indicates success and the other indicates failure. </p>

		<pre>
		fn main() {

			let error_result:Result&lt;i32,&amp;str&gt; = std::result::Result::&lt;i32, &amp;str&gt;::Err("Could not open file");
			let ok_result:Result&lt;i32,&amp;str&gt; = std::result::Result::&lt;i32, &amp;str&gt;::Ok(42);

			let result = ok_result;
		}
		</pre>
	</li>


	<li><p>One very handy use of the <code>match</code> statement is <i>destructuring</i>
		complex objects. This allows the programmer to easily take apart more complex
		structures using pattern matching. For example, re-write your code from the last
		question using the following partial match statement:
		</p>

	<pre>
	match result {
		Ok(x) => ,
		Err(y) => ,
	};
	</pre>
	</li>


	<li><p>In Studio 1 you had to evaluate the result of your stdin().read_line() call
		and distinguish between an OK return value of zero, any other OK return value,
		and an error value. Re-write your code from Studio 1 using a match statement
		similar to the one from the last question.</p></li>


	<li><p>Our goal for this studio is to produce a project called <code>print_file</code>.
		This program reads from standard input in a loop. When the user enters any
		input, the program attempts to open it as though it were a filename. If it
		is successful, it prints the contents of the file to the terminal. If it
		is not successful, it prints a descriptive error message indicating what
		went wrong. In either case, the program goes back to the top of the loop
		and waits for another program name to be input. If the user enters
		CTRL-D on an empty line (or CTRL-Z on Windows) then the program terminates.</p>

	<p>You have some code from Studio 1 that reads input in a loop. Go ahead and copy-paste
	that code as your starting point.</p></li>


	<li><p>After you successfully get user input, try to open it as a file using
		<code>File::open()</code>. Note that your user input will have
		a new line character at the end of it, but the string method
		<code>trim()</code> is made specifically to remove whitespace
		and new line characters.</p>

		<p>After you attempt to open the file, use a match
		statement to print a descriptive error on failure, or return
		the contents of <code>Ok()</code> on success.</p></li>

	<li><p>Lastly, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#method.read_to_string">
		use the method <code>read_to_string()</code></a> to read the contents
	of the file, and then print the contents of the file with <code>print!()</code>.</p>

		<p>The <code>read_to_string()</code> method also returns a Result, and you
		should handle it appropriately.</p></li>


	<li><p>Once you're done, test your program to make sure that your code works
		correctly when the files given are real, functional files. Then,
		give your program a made up file name that doesn't exist, and verify
		that it prints an error message mentioning the fact that the file does
		not exist. Lastly, create a file that exists, but has invalid permissions
		so that your program cannot read the file. Verify that your program
		prints a descriptive error message that mentions file permissions when this
		fails.</p>

		<p>Hint: The return value in Err() should already contain a descriptive
		(if perhaps poorly formatted) message. That is all you need to print.</p>

		<p>You can make a file and change it's permissions in Linux/Unix using the
		<code>touch</code> and <code>chmod</code> programs. If you execute
		"<code>touch inavlid.txt</code>" you will create a file called invalid.txt,
		and then execute "<code>chmod -r invalid.txt</code>" to remove the read
		permission from that file. If you are working on Windows, you will need
		to look up how to create an empty file and set file permissions.</p></li>


</ol>

<p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>The pattern matching facility in Rust has a number of fancy tricks
		we do not cover here. One such is matching multiple patterns to the same
		output statement using the vertical stroke "|" symbol.</p>

		<p>Try writing a statement that matches the first five even numbers
	and prints the word "Even", but you are only allowed to use one print statement.</li>

	<li><p>"Match guards" allow you to introduce if-conditionals into your match
		statements. Write a match statement that prints "Negative!" if the
		input is less than zero, "Positive!" if the input is greater than
		zero, and "Zero!" otherwise.</p></li>
