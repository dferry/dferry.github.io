<h3>Components of MATLAB's Desktop</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Command Window</b><br>
      This is the primary interface for MATLAB's interpreter.
      It is where commands are entered in order to be executed.
      With octave, this is the only component.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Command History</b><br>
      This provides a history of all commands that were entered into
      the Command Window, including from previous sessions. You may
      click/drag past commands to re-execute them in the Command Window.
      It is also possible to revisit past commands directly at the
      Command Window prompt by using the up/down arrows.

  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Workspace</b><br>
      This provides a view of all currently defined variables during a
      MATLAB session.  For each variable it can display the name, the
      data class, the array size, and the values.  It is also possible
      to edit an existing variable graphically by double clicking on
      its name, invoking the spreadsheet-like Variable Editor.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Current Directory</b><br>
      Script and function m-files from the current directory can be
      used directly from the command window.  The current directory is
      also relevant when saving and loading data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing the Workspace</h3>

Some useful commands

<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      x = value;
      </tt></b><br>
      assigns the variable name <tt>x</tt> to whatever value is
      expressed on the righthand side of the assignment operator&nbsp(<tt>=</tt>).
      If <tt>x</tt> had previously been defined, this assignment
      reassigns the name to the new value.
      <p>
      If an expression is ever entered without an explicit assignment,
      the result will automatically be assigned the the variable
      <tt>ans</tt>.
      <p>
      By default, the result of each command is automatically echoed
      by MATLAB.  To avoid that output, a command must be followed by
      a semicolon&nbsp;(<tt>;</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      who
      </tt></b><br>
      lists the names of all variables currently defined in the workspace.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      whos
      </tt></b><br>
      lists the names and associated data for all variables currently defined in the workspace.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      clear x
      </tt></b><br>
      removes the variable <tt>x</tt> from the current workspace.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      clear
      </tt></b><br>
      clears the workspace of all previously defined variables.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      clc
      </tt></b><br>
      visibly clears the command window (but leaves the underlying
      workspace unchanged).
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      disp(x)
      </tt></b><br>
      displays the value of x (but without displaying the variable name).
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      help x
      </tt></b><br>
      prints informational text about x in the command window.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b><tt>
      doc x
      </tt></b><br>
      brings up the MATLAB documentation viewer with (typically) more extensive
      information about topic x.
  </li>


</ul>

<h3>Creating and using an "m-file"</h3>

<p>
While the interactive Command Window is convenient, we do not always
want to restart from scratch or to have to retype a long series of
commands.  We can save a series of commands in a text file that is
traditionally known as an "m-file" in MATLAB lingo (because it is
saved using a filename such as <tt>myproject.m</tt>).



<p>
The percent sign is used in MATLAB to designate the remainder of
any line as a comment.  This provides a convenient way for
documenting portions of your source code.  For example, you might
write
<pre>
gravity = 9.8;       % measured in meters/second^2
</pre>
