<P>
<b>Topic:</b>  Project Proposal

<br>


<p>
As a final assignment at the end of the semester, I would like you
(and a partner) to design and implement a project on a topic of
your choice (ideally, something related to your primary academic studies
or to personal interest of your own). We have seen a variety of topics
in this class beyond the core programming content: physical simulation,
games of chance, stock market analysis, DNA transcription, simple encryption,
and other. In the next three weeks we will look at audio and image processing,
and maze traversal as well.

<p>
 Your
project may emphasize programming, simulation, and problem solving, but it could
also focus on using MATLAB's built in graphing, visualization, audio, etc. capabilities.




<p>
The project is a substantial part of your semester grade and the size and scope
of your proposal should reflect that. 

<ol><li>Plan on between one and two homework assigments' worth of effort and time to be spent on the project. </li>
<li>Good projects must have a definite element of programming (should not just execute a fixed set of statements in a script).</li>
<li>Projects <i>do not</i> need to be original or novel. Implementing your own solution to a previously solved problem, or implementing your own version of a previously described algorithm, is perfectly fine.
</ol>



<p>
Your group must submit a
formal project proposal. I will review the
proposals and either approve the suggested project or work with you
in revising the proposal. Your proposal should
provide the following information:
<ul>
  <li>
      Your name and the name of a partner
  </li>
  <li>
      A project title
  </li>
  <li>
      A summary of the problem to be solved
  </li>
</ul>
The complete proposal should be a one or two page document.


<p>
You and your partner should submit a single
proposal together.  If you need assistance in finding a suitable
partner, please speak with me as soon as possible.

<p>
Some examples of successful projects in the past:

<ul>
<li>Traffic intersection simulation</li>
<li>Real-time replay of rocket telemetry</li>
<li>Comparing/contrasting WW2 fighter planes</li>
<li>Cataloging the decline of honey bee populations in each state</li>
<li>A text adventure game</li>
<li>Role-playing game character optimizer</li>
<li>Randomized music composer</li>
</ul>
