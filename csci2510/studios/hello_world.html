<p>Let's get started with two simple "Hello, world!" programs
that demonstrate the difference between doing standard output with the
C standard library versus Linux system calls.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the built-in Linux manual (man pages) to look up certain functions
  <li>Write a "Hello, world!" program using the C standard library
  <li>Write a "Hello, world!" program using Linux system calls
</ol>

<p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers in a text
file. When finished, submit your code and text file to the git respository
under the appropriate folder.</p>

<!--When finished, submit your work by sending your text file and
source code to <strong>dferry_submit@slu.edu</strong>
with the phrase <strong>
Hello, world!
</strong> in the subject line.</p>-->

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Required Exercises</h3></p>

<ol>
<p><li>First we need a Linux environment. You can login locally to a Linux
machine in the classroom or lab, or you can remotely connect to the department
server at <i>hopper.slu.edu</i>. Alternatively, you can login locally and then
also connect to hopper so that you can always access your work remotely.
In general you will only ever need Linux terminal
access for these exercises, though you're welcome to use a GUI desktop.</p>

<p>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.</p>

<p><li>Your first task is to write a "Hello, world!" program using the function
<code>fprintf()</code> in the C standard library. To do so, pull up the function's
documentation by typing "<code>man fprintf</code>" in the Linux terminal. This
page tells you everything you need to know in order to use 
<code>fprintf()</code> in a program. As the answer to this exercise, give the
<code>#include</code> header file(s) needed for this function (look right
beneath the "SYNOPSIS" heading).</p>

<p><li>Now look at the function signatures for both <code>fprintf()</code> and
the <code>printf()</code>. What is the difference? (Signature is a name
for the argument list.)</p>

<p><li>Look at the first paragraph under the "DESCRIPTION" heading. What is the
described difference between the <code>printf()</code> and
<code>fprintf()</code> functions?</p>

<p><li>Let's put our newfound knowledge to use! Quit out of the man page by
pressing "q" and create a text file called "hello_fprintf.c". Finish the
following empty program so that it prints a message of your choice.</p>

<p><code>
// Your name<br>
// The date<br>
// A short description of your program<br>
<br>
// Include file goes here<br>
<br>
int main( int argc, char* argv[] ){<br>
<br>
  //Make a call to fprintf() here<br>
<br>
  return 0;<br>
}<br>
</code></p>

<p>The first argument of <code>fprintf()</code> must specify an I/O stream. In
this case you should use "<code>stdout</code>". This is a special stream that
prints to the Linux console, but this function works for a variety of
stream-oriented operations, such as writing to a file or sending data over
a network. The second argument should be a string literal
that gives your message, and should be terminated with "<code>\n</code>"
(the newline character). For example, your string literal might look like:</p>

<p><code>"Hello, world!\n"</code></p>

<p>You can compile your program with the command:<br>
<code>gcc -o hello_fprintf hello_fprintf.c</code>
</p>

<p>Run your program by typing "<code>./hello_fprintf</code>". 
If your program runs correctly then copy and paste
your terminal output as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>Great! Now we want to accomplish the same thing but using a system call
directly, as opposed to the C library. The particular system call we want to
use is called <code>write()</code>. However, if you give the command
"<code>man write</code>" you won't arrive at the correct documentation because
there are multiple pages that might apply to such a common term. Instead,
give the command "<code>man man</code>" to pull up the documentation for the
manual system.</p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, give the <i>section number</i> for system
calls.</p>

<p><li>Now, use the answer to the last exercise to look up the documentation
for the <code>write()</code> system call. The syntax you should use is:</p>

<p><code>man &lt;section number&gt; write</code></p>

<p>For example, the command "<code>man 3 fprintf</code>" would take you to the
documentation page used previously, but explicitly states to look in the
standard library section of the manual. 
As the answer to this exercise, give the header file
which must be included to use the <code>write()</code> system call (again, look
beneath the "SYNOPSIS" statement).</p>

<p><li>Make a copy of your program called <code>hello_write.c</code>. The Linux
terminal command to copy a file is <code>cp</code>. In this case, you should
execute the command:</p>

<p><code>cp hello_fprintf.c hello_write.c</code></p>

<p>Leave the answer for this exercise blank.</p>

<p><li>The <code>fprintf()</code> function doesn't actually implement the code
that allows your program to print to the terminal, it relies on the operating
system to do that. The OS provides a <b><i>system call</i></b> called 
<code>write()</code> that gives this functionality, and <code>fprintf()</code>
calls this function on your behalf. However, you can call <code>write()</code>
directly, which is what we will do now.

<p>Modify your program to use <code>write()</code> instead of
<code>fprintf()</code>. There are two differences between the functions. The
first is that you need to use a <i>file descriptor</i> instead of a <i>file stream</i>.
In other words, replace the built-in variable "<code>stdout</code>" with the
built-in variable "<code>STDOUT_FILENO</code>". Both variables refer to the
same "thing" but in different ways.</p>

<p>The second difference is that <code>write()</code> operates on a character
buffer (a vector of characters) rather than a string literal. You can declare
a character buffer as such:</p>

<p><code>char buffer[] = "Hello, world!\n";</code></p>

<p>You will also need to tell <code>write()</code> how large the character
buffer is. When counting how many characters is in your buffer, don't forget
the newline character <code>'\n'</code>. Note that the whole newline character 
escape sequence (<code>'\n'</code>) counts as one character.
Once you are finished, copy and paste your program output
as the answer to this exercise.</p>

<p><li>Try changing the third argument of <code>write()</code> to be much
larger than your character buffer (say, 100 or 1000). What happens? Why
do you think this is?</p>


<p><li>The function <code>fprintf()</code> is provided by the <i>C standard library</i>
and is guaranteed to exist for any standards-compliant C language 
implementation- even on other operating systems. The <code>write()</code>
system call is not guaranteed to exist as it is provided by the operating
system itself. Many system calls (but not all) have C library versions.

<p>Thinking as a software developer, speculate a situation when you would want to use a
C library function and another situation when you would want to use an
OS system call.
