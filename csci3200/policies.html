      <li> Homework and Programming Assignments (50%)

	<p> There will be a series of written homeworks, essay assignments 
in the class, and programming assignments which (in total) will compromise 
50% of your final score.  Essays will be over papers assigned in class.  

      </li>
    
     <li> Quizzes or in class work (10%)
     
     <p>A total of 10% of your final grade is reserved for in class exercises and quizzes, at the instructor's discretion.

	<li> Exams (40%)

	<p> There will be a midterm worth 20% of your total grade, and a 
final exam worth 20% of your total grade.  Please see the course schedule for dates.

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.

	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.

	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.

	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>


  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

	<p> 
 Homeworks will generally be due at 11:59pm via email.  Late 
submissions will generally not be accepted unless arrangements have been made 
ahead of time.  Please contact me as early as possible with any potential 
issues, since I am much more likely to grant an extension if you come to be 
ahead of time!  In general, I try to be flexible if students have good reason, 
but I do reserve the right to not accept late submissions if solutions have 
already been released or if a student is abusing this flexibility.

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you 
think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written 
explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general
course material, which includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a
student misses class, and working on any practice problems which are
assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will
be completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the
assignment description, any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the <b> only </b> acceptable
sources of information are the course textbook, the instructor, official
university tutors, or other sources which are explicitly mentioned in an
assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including (but not
limited to) websites other than the official course website or those
explicitly listed in course materials, textbooks other than those
officially listed below, or students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to 
the department.  First time offenses on homework will result in a minimum
of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with egregious or
repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition,
students may be referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further
disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student 
academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with
the policies described.</p>

<p>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.” Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service through which SLU fulfills its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern. The full University-level Academic Integrity Policy can be found on the Provost's Office website at: https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/academic-integrity-policy.pdf.</p>

<p>Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.</p>

<A name="title9"><h3>Title IX</h3></A>

<p>Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic or dating violence, we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX Coordinator that you shared an experience relating to Title IX.  This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.</p>

<p>Anna Kratky is the Title IX Coordinator at Saint Louis University (DuBourg Hall, room 36; anna.kratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886). If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or make an anonymous report through SLU’s Integrity Hotline by calling 1-877-525-5669 or online at http://www.lighthouse-services.com/slu.

<LI>
<A name="disabilities"><h3>Disability Services</h3></A>

<p>Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course.</p>

<p>Please contact the Center for Accessibility and Disability Resources (CADR) to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St. Louis campus will contact CADR, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at accessibility_disability@slu.edu or by phone at 314.977.3484. Once approved, information about a student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from CADR and within the instructor’s official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to CADR. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries.</p>


<p>Note: Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one are encouraged to contact to Disability Services.
