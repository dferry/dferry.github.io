<!--
<li><p> May 1: The <a href="finalreview.pdf">final review sheet</a> is posted.  Note that this is a preliminary version!  Please check back on Saturday to be sure it has not had any questions added.  (The same link will work; I will just transfer a newer pdf if I update it.)

<li><p> April 24: The final homework, covering prolog, is now posted on the homeworks page.  It will be due on Friday, May 2, by midnight; please submit via git.


<li><p> March 29: Given my upcoming travel, I went ahead and posted the next couple of homeworks a bit early on the homework page (although you don't need to start them immediately).  Homework 9 will be due on Sunday April 14, and homework 10 (the essay on functional programming) will be due on April 24.

<li><p> March 27: Homework 8 is now posted (on the homework page); it will be due by Sunday, April 7, at midnight.

<li><p> March 22: Homework 7 is now posted (on the homework page); it will be due next Friday by midnight via git.

<li><p> March 15: To get you warmed up for functional programming, <a href="https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536">here is a nice essay</a> on how to dive into the FP mindset.  See you all for Haskell fun after the break!

<li><p> March 1: Homework 6 is now available on the homework page; it will be due on the Wednesday after spring break, March 20, by 11:59pm (via email) - you're 
also welcome to give me a physical copy sometime Wednesday if you prefer.  Please plan your time accordingly - this is a more open ended essay, so while I certainly don't 
want you to spend your entire break on it, you may want to at least be doing some reading to familiarize yourself with your chosen language over the break!

<li><p> Feb. 27: As promised, here is the <a href="mtreview.pdf">midterm exam review guide</a>.  Practice midterms will be available by next Monday, and will be handed out in class.


<li><p> Feb. 22: Homework 5 is now posted.  It will be due on Monday, March 4, by the start of class.

<li><p> Feb. 18: Minor typo on the homework: the string in problem 2 should parse.  (I mistakenly said "shouldn't" in the homework.) I've updated the pdf to use the correct langauge now.


<li> <p> Jan 16: There will be no class on Friday, Jan. 18.  Please read section 2.1 of the textbook, as well as the first two pages of section 2.2, in preparation for next week.  Since I will be gone Friday, I've also uploaded the next homework a bit early.  It's officially supposed to come out next week, but you should be able to start the first problem after today's lecture, for those who want to get a bit ahead!

<li>Mar. 23: <p>Homework 5 is now posted.  It will be due the day we get back from Easter Break- Wednesday, April 3. This assignment invovles drawing DFAs and NFAs, so it will be submitted on paper in class during classtime. (In particular, the assignment is due during class, not at 11:59pm as with past homeworks. 

<li>Mar. 22: <p>You will be getting your midterms back today. I have posted an aggregate analysis of the class performance on the schedule. We will be discussing this in class.

<li>Feb. 26: <p>The survey result is in, and the class opted to have our midterm exam on the Friday before break, March 8.  We will have a review session in class on Monday, March 4.

<li>Feb 25: <p>Homework 4 is now posted.  It will be due next Wednesday, Mar 6. 

<li>Feb 12: <p>Due to Github troubles, the due date for Homework 3 is moved to Feb 14 at 11:59pm.

<li>Feb 4: <p>The due date for Homework 2 is moved to Feb 5 at 11:59pm.

<li>Feb 4: <p>Homework 3 is posted. Currently there is only an autograder for part 1, but I plan on adding an autograder for parts 2 and 3 soon.

<li>Feb 1: <p>A Github submission link to the second homework (first programming homework) has been posted to the assignments page. We will discuss the submission process in class tomorrow.

<li>Feb 1: <p>A response to several questions I have gotten: Why study functional programming languages? There are two good sources here, if you're interested. One we mentioned in class- <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?</a> Another is here: <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf">Why Functional Programming Matters</a>. Here is also a <a href="https://medium.com/luteceo-software-chemistry/can-programming-be-liberated-from-the-von-neumann-style-932ba107402b">more recent analysis</a> of the first paper which is a more modern (and possibly easier) read on his arguments.  

<li>Jan 26: <p>The second homework, our first Haskell assignment, has been posted. This is a coding assignment, and is due next Friday, Feb. 2, by midnight. This assignment will be submitted via Github classroom... I will post the submission link early next week.

<li>Jan 17: <p>The first homework has been posted on the homework page.  It is an essay assignment, which will be due next Friday, Jan. 26, by midnight.  Please submit your essay via Canvas.

<li>Welcome to programming languages!  Please make sure to read the course
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section
